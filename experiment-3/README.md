# Extracting character relations from fictional literature

Project pipeline:
          -> characters -> main characters -> char pairs \
raw text                                                  âŸ© windowed spans in paragraphs with chars => relations
          -> paragraphs -> tokens                        /


I. Raw text -> paragraphs

Ideally, splitting should support streaming of files / additional tokenization / lemmatization / name normalization would be cool, like the one done by book-nlp but price of this is lack of flexibility for some things

II. Raw text -> characters

Supposedly, NER with ability to solve coreferences / aliasing used in fictional text
1) can be partially solved by additional data from dbpedia
2) aliasing based on rules (titles, initials, etc)
3) ???
