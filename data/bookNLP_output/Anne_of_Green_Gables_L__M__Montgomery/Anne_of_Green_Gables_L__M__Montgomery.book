But when she began to sing I never thought about anything else . Oh , I ca n't tell you how I felt . But it seemed to me that it could never be hard to be good any more . I felt like I do when I look up to the stars . Tears came into my eyes , but , oh , they were such happy tears . I was so sorry when it was all over , and I told Miss Barry I did n't see how I was ever to return to common life again . She said she thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me . That sounded so prosaic ; but to my surprise I found it true . The ice cream was delicious , Marilla , and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o'clock at night . Diana said she believed she was born for city life . Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was , but I said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her what I really thought . So I thought it over after I went to bed . That is the best time to think things out . And I came to the conclusion , Marilla , that I was n't born for city life and that I was glad of it . It 's nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o'clock at night once in a while ; but as a regular thing I 'd rather be in the east gable at eleven , sound asleep , but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook . I told Miss Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed . Miss Barry generally laughed at anything I said , even when I said the most solemn things .

I meant to tell you , Marilla , honestly I did , but I forgot . Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history . Jane Andrews lent it to me . I was reading it at dinner hour , and I had just got to the chariot race when school went in . I was simply wild to know how it turned out -- although I felt sure Ben Hur must win , because it would n't be poetical justice if he did n't -- so I spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee . I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history , you know , while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur . I was so interested in it that I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at once I just looked up and there she was looking down at me , so reproachful-like . I ca n't tell you how ashamed I felt , Marilla , especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling . Miss Stacy took Ben Hur away , but she never said a word then . She kept me in at recess and talked to me . She said I had done very wrong in two respects . First , I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies ; and secondly , I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead . I had never realized until that moment , Marilla , that what I was doing was deceitful . I was shocked . I cried bitterly , and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I 'd never do such a thing again ; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week , not even to see how the chariot race turned out . But Miss Stacy said she would n't require that , and she forgave me freely . So I think it was n't very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all .

Her cousin lives there and Mrs. Spencer has visited here and knows all about it . So Matthew and I have talked it over off and on ever since . We thought we 'd get a boy . Matthew is getting up in years , you know -- he 's sixty -- and he is n't so spry as he once was . His heart troubles him a good deal . And you know how desperate hard it 's got to be to get hired help . There 's never anybody to be had but those stupid , half-grown little French boys ; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he 's up and off to the lobster canneries or the States . At first Matthew suggested getting a Home boy . But I said ` no ' flat to that . ` They may be all right -- I 'm not saying they 're not -- but no London street Arabs for me , ' I said . ` Give me a native born at least . There 'll be a risk , no matter who we get . But I 'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian . ' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl . We heard last week she was going , so we sent her word by Richard Spencer 's folks at Carmody to bring us a smart , likely boy of about ten or eleven . We decided that would be the best age -- old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper . We mean to give him a good home and schooling . We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today -- the mail-man brought it from the station -- saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight .

It seems uncanny to think of a child at Green Gables somehow ; there 's never been one there , for Matthew and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built -- if they ever WERE children , which is hard to believe when one looks at them .

But today it was different . The others who were late should have been punished as well as Anne , that 's what . And I do n't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment .

The less fuss made the better , in my opinion . She wo n't miss much by not going to school , as far as THAT goes . Mr. Phillips is n't any good at all as a teacher . The order he keeps is scandalous , that 's what , and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big scholars he 's getting ready for Queen 's . He 'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle had n't been a trustee -- THE trustee , for he just leads the other two around by the nose , that 's what .

She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you , Diana , it is uphill work . There 's so little scope for imagination in cookery . You just have to go by rules . The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in . I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me , Diana . I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you , but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life ; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears ; and you never , never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you . Oh , it was such a pathetic tale , Diana . The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake . But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure . Flour is so essential to cakes , you know . Marilla was very cross and I do n't wonder . I 'm a great trial to her . She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week . We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over . Marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it . I meant to cover it just as much as could be , Diana , but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun -- of course I 'm a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic -- taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion ; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce . I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry . Diana , fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce ! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters . Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I 'd give the sauce to the pigs ; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow , whichever they wanted to be , so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples . Well , Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning . You know they are very stylish people , especially Mrs. Chester Ross . When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table . I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be , for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I was n't pretty . Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce WARMED UP , in the other . Diana , that was a terrible moment . I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out ` Marilla , you must n't use that pudding sauce . There was a mouse drowned in it . I forgot to tell you before . ' Oh , Diana , I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred . Mrs. Chester Ross just LOOKED at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with mortification . She is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us . Marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word -- then . She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves . She even offered me some , but I could n't swallow a mouthful . It was like heaping coals of fire on my head . After Mrs. Chester Ross went away , Marilla gave me a dreadful scolding . Why , Diana , what is the matter ?

So I took the brooch . I thought I could put it back before you came home . I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time .

She was leaning out to pick water lilies and if Mr. Andrews had n't caught her by her sash just in the nick of time she 'd fallen in and prob ` ly been drowned . I wish it had been me .

'' ","i":66257},{"w":"`` I know people who have seen them . And they are respectable people . Charlie Sloane says that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night after he 'd been buried for a year . You know Charlie Sloane 's grandmother would n't tell a story for anything . She 's a very religious woman . And Mrs. Thomas 's father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin . He said he knew it was the spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine days . He did n't , but he died two years after , so you see it was really true . And Ruby Gillis says -- '' ","i":66362},{"w":"`` Anne Shirley , '' ","i":66498},{"w":"`` I never want to hear you talking in this fashion again . I 've had my doubts about that imagination of yours right along , and if this is going to be the outcome of it , I wo n't countenance any such doings . You 'll go right over to Barry 's , and you 'll go through that spruce grove , just for a lesson and a warning to you . And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods again .

It was Ruby Gillis started it . Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr. Phillips , but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into tears . Then all the girls began to cry , one after the other . I tried to hold out , Marilla . I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips made me sit with Gil -- with a , boy ; and the time he spelled my name without an e on the blackboard ; and how he said I was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling ; and all the times he had been so horrid and sarcastic ; but somehow I could n't , Marilla , and I just had to cry too . Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she 'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she 'd never shed a tear . Well , she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother -- of course the boys did n't cry -- because she had n't brought one of her own , not expecting to need it . Oh , Marilla , it was heartrending . Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning , ` The time has come for us to part . ' It was very affecting . And he had tears in his eyes too , Marilla . Oh , I felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I 'd talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy . I can tell you I wished I 'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews . She had n't anything on her conscience . The girls cried all the way home from school . Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes , ` The time has come for us to part , ' and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up . I do feel dreadfully sad , Marilla . But one ca n't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months ' vacation before them , can they , Marilla ? And besides , we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station . For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I could n't help taking a little interest in a new minister , could I ? His wife is very pretty . Not exactly regally lovely , of course -- it would n't do , I suppose , for a minister to have a regally lovely wife , because it might set a bad example . Mrs. Lynde says the minister 's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably . Our new minister 's wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses . Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister 's wife , but I did n't make any such uncharitable remark , Marilla , because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves . Besides , she 's only been a minister 's wife for a little while , so one should make allowances , should n't they ? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready .

I mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and I shall never try to be beautiful again . Of course it 's better to be good . I know it is , but it 's sometimes so hard to believe a thing even when you know it . I do really want to be good , Marilla , like you and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy , and grow up to be a credit to you . Diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side . She says she thinks it will be very becoming .

Marilla always makes my dresses fashionably now , because she says she does n't intend to have Matthew going to Mrs. Lynde to make them . I 'm so glad . It is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable . At least , it is easier for me . I suppose it does n't make such a difference to naturally good people . But Matthew said I must have a new coat , so Marilla bought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth , and it 's being made by a real dressmaker over at Carmody . It 's to be done Saturday night , and I 'm trying not to imagine myself walking up the church aisle on Sunday in my new suit and cap , because I 'm afraid it is n't right to imagine such things . But it just slips into my mind in spite of me . My cap is so pretty . Matthew bought it for me the day we were over at Carmody . It is one of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage , with gold cord and tassels . Your new hat is elegant , Diana , and so becoming . When I saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend . Do you suppose it 's wrong for us to think so much about our clothes ?

That 's easy enough , for Matthew does n't go about looking for excitement by any means and never did , but he 's not to do any very heavy work either and you might as well tell Matthew not to breathe as not to work .

Time was when he would take my advice , but now he just buys things for Anne regardless , and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on him .
