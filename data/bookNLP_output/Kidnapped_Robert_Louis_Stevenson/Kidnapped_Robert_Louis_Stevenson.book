'' ","i":34406},{"w":"`` Ah ! '' ","i":34474},{"w":"`` I got my wastefulness from the same man I got the buttons from ; and that was my poor father , Duncan Stewart , grace be to him ! He was the prettiest man of his kindred ; and the best swordsman in the Hielands , David , and that is the same as to say , in all the world , I should ken , for it was him that taught me . He was in the Black Watch , when first it was mustered ; and , like other gentlemen privates , had a gillie at his back to carry his firelock for him on the march . Well , the King , it appears , was wishful to see Hieland swordsmanship ; and my father and three more were chosen out and sent to London town , to let him see it at the best . So they were had into the palace and showed the whole art of the sword for two hours at a stretch , before King George and Queen Carline , and the Butcher Cumberland , and many more of whom I havenae mind . And when they were through , the King -LRB- for all he was a rank usurper -RRB- spoke them fair and gave each man three guineas in his hand . Now , as they were going out of the palace , they had a porter 's lodge to go by ; and it came in on my father , as he was perhaps the first private Hieland gentleman that had ever gone by that door , it was right he should give the poor porter a proper notion of their quality . So he gives the King 's three guineas into the man 's hand , as if it was his common custom ; the three others that came behind him did the same ; and there they were on the street , never a penny the better for their pains . Some say it was one , that was the first to fee the King 's porter ; and some say it was another ; but the truth of it is , that it was Duncan Stewart , as I am willing to prove with either sword or pistol . And that was the father that I had , God rest him ! '' ","i":34486},{"w":"`` That was I , '' ","i":34980},{"w":"`` Ay '' ","i":35058},{"w":"`` if they got hands on me , it would be a short shrift and a lang tow for Alan !

'' ","i":35183},{"w":"`` Ye see , David , he that was all his life so great a man , and come of the blood and bearing the name of kings , is now brought down to live in a French town like a poor and private person . He that had four hundred swords at his whistle , I have seen , with these eyes of mine , buying butter in the market-place , and taking it home in a kale-leaf . This is not only a pain but a disgrace to us of his family and clan . There are the bairns forby , the children and the hope of Appin , that must be learned their letters and how to hold a sword , in that far country . Now , the tenants of Appin have to pay a rent to King George ; but their hearts are staunch , they are true to their chief ; and what with love and a bit of pressure , and maybe a threat or two , the poor folk scrape up a second rent for Ardshiel . Well , David , I 'm the hand that carries it . '' ","i":35331},{"w":"`` Ay , David , '' ","i":35574},{"w":"`` Who is he ? '' ","i":35848},{"w":"`` But when it came to Colin Roy , the black Campbell blood in him ran wild . He sat gnashing his teeth at the wine table .

'' ","i":36250},{"w":"`` Ay , '' ","i":36452},{"w":"`` ye 'll never guess that ! For these same Stewarts , and Maccolls , and Macrobs -LRB- that had two rents to pay , one to King George by stark force , and one to Ardshiel by natural kindness -RRB- offered him a better price than any Campbell in all broad Scotland ; and far he sent seeking them -- as far as to the sides of Clyde and the cross of Edinburgh -- seeking , and fleeching , and begging them to come , where there was a Stewart to be starved and a red-headed hound of a Campbell to be pleasured ! '' ","i":36459},{"w":"`` Him beaten ? '' ","i":36604},{"w":"`` And that 's a good observe , David , '' ","i":36739},{"w":"`` Ay '' ","i":36824},{"w":"`` it 's well seen it was a Campbell taught ye ! It would be a convenient world for them and their sort , if there was no such a thing as a lad and a gun behind a heather bush ! But that 's nothing to the point . This is what he did . '' ","i":36830},{"w":"`` Well , David , '' ","i":36899},{"w":"`` since he couldnae be rid of the loyal commons by fair means , he swore he would be rid of them by foul . Ardshiel was to starve : that was the thing he aimed at . And since them that fed him in his exile wouldnae be bought out -- right or wrong , he would drive them out . Therefore he sent for lawyers , and papers , and red-coats to stand at his back . And the kindly folk of that country must all pack and tramp , every father 's son out of his father 's house , and out of the place where he was bred and fed , and played when he was a callant . And who are to succeed them ? Bare-leggit beggars ! King George is to whistle for his rents ; he maun dow with less ; he can spread his butter thinner : what cares Red Colin ? If he can hurt Ardshiel , he has his wish ; if he can pluck the meat from my chieftain 's table , and the bit toys out of his children 's hands , he will gang hame singing to Glenure ! '' ","i":36908},{"w":"`` Ye 're a good lad in a fight , '' ","i":37187},{"w":"`` but , man ! ye have Whig blood in ye ! '' ","i":37201},{"w":"`` It 's easier than ye would think , '' ","i":37273},{"w":"`` A bare hillside -LRB- ye see -RRB- is like all one road ; if there 's a sentry at one place , ye just go by another . And then the heather 's a great help . And everywhere there are friends ' houses and friends ' byres and haystacks . And besides , when folk talk of a country covered with troops , it 's but a kind of a byword at the best . A soldier covers nae mair of it than his boot-soles . I have fished a water with a sentry on the other side of the brae , and killed a fine trout ; and I have sat in a heather bush within six feet of another , and learned a real bonny tune from his whistling . This was it , '' ","i":37286},{"w":"`` And then , besides , '' ","i":37434},{"w":"`` it 's no sae bad now as it was in forty-six . The Hielands are what they call pacified .

Not long , ye would think , with men like Ardshiel in exile and men like the Red Fox sitting birling the wine and oppressing the poor at home . But it 's a kittle thing to decide what folk 'll bear , and what they will not . Or why would Red Colin be riding his horse all over my poor country of Appin , and never a pretty lad to put a bullet in him ? '' ","i":37444},{"w":"`` Is this one of your tricks ?

For if it was the other way round about , and the lad whom I couldnae just clearly see had been in our shoes , and we in his -LRB- as might very well have been -RRB- , I think we would be a good deal obliged to him oursel 's if he would draw the soldiers .
