He was a French gentleman ; a scientific gentleman ; a man of great acquirements -- a Doctor . '' ","i":8704},{"w":"`` I speak , miss , of twenty years ago . He married -- an English lady -- and I was one of the trustees . His affairs , like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families , were entirely in Tellson 's hands . In a similar way I am , or I have been , trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers . These are mere business relations , miss ; there is no friendship in them , no particular interest , nothing like sentiment . I have passed from one to another , in the course of my business life , just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day ; in short , I have no feelings ; I am a mere machine . To go on -- '' ","i":8837},{"w":"`` But this is my father 's story , sir ; and I begin to think '' ","i":8986},{"w":"`` that when I was left an orphan through my mother 's surviving my father only two years , it was you who brought me to England .

And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now , in saying I had no feelings , and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations , when you reflect that I have never seen you since . No ; you have been the ward of Tellson 's House since , and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson 's House since . Feelings ! I have no time for them , no chance of them . I pass my whole life , miss , in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle . '' ","i":9136},{"w":"`` Pray , '' ","i":9360},{"w":"`` pray control your agitation -- a matter of business .

'' ","i":9431},{"w":"`` That 's right , that 's right . Courage ! Business ! You have business before you ; useful business . Miss Manette , your mother took this course with you . And when she died -- I believe broken-hearted -- having never slackened her unavailing search for your father , she left you , at two years old , to grow to be blooming , beautiful , and happy , without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison , or wasted there through many lingering years .

It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries , because it would be dangerous . Better not to mention the subject , anywhere or in any way , and to remove him -- for a while at all events -- out of France . Even I , safe as an Englishman , and even Tellson 's , important as they are to French credit , avoid all naming of the matter . I carry about me , not a scrap of writing openly referring to it . This is a secret service altogether . My credentials , entries , and memoranda , are all comprehended in the one line , ` Recalled to Life ; ' which may mean anything . But what is the matter !

'' ","i":41238},{"w":"`` True , '' ","i":41321},{"w":"`` and fearful to reflect upon . Yet , a doubt lurks in my mind , Miss Pross , whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him .

Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense , and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition , I am well out of my mistake , and no harm is done . Young women have committed similar follies often before , and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before . In an unselfish aspect , I am sorry that the thing is dropped , because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view ; in a selfish aspect , I am glad that the thing has dropped , because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view -- it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it . There is no harm at all done . I have not proposed to the young lady , and , between ourselves , I am by no means certain , on reflection , that I ever should have committed myself to that extent . Mr. Lorry , you can not control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls ; you must not expect to do it , or you will always be disappointed . Now , pray say no more about it . I tell you , I regret it on account of others , but I am satisfied on my own account . And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you , and for giving me your advice ; you know the young lady better than I do ; you were right , it never would have done .

It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered , so completely , as to be a highly intelligent man , capable of close application of mind , and great exertion of body , and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge , which was already very large .
