TIME , as Chorus SCENE : Sometimes in Sicilia ; sometimes in Bohemia . ACT I. SCENE I. Sicilia . An Antechamber in LEONTES ' Palace . -LSB- Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS -RSB- ARCHIDAMUS . If you shall chance , Camillo , to visit Bohemia , on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot , you shall see , as I have said , great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia . CAMILLO . I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him . ARCHIDAMUS . Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves ; for indeed , -- CAMILLO . Beseech you , -- ARCHIDAMUS . Verily , I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge : we can not with such magnificence -- in so rare -- I know not what to say . -- We will give you sleepy drinks , that your senses , unintelligent of our insufficience , may , though they can not praise us , as little accuse us . CAMILLO . You pay a great deal too dear for what 's given freely . ARCHIDAMUS . Believe me , I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance . CAMILLO . Sicilia can not show himself overkind to Bohemia . They were trained together in their childhoods ; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which can not choose but branch now . Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society , their encounters , though not personal , have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts , letters , loving embassies ; that they have seemed to be together , though absent ; shook hands , as over a vast ; and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds . The heavens continue their loves ! ARCHIDAMUS . I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it . You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius : it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note . CAMILLO . I very well agree with you in the hopes of him . It is a gallant child ; one that indeed physics the subject , makes old hearts fresh : they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man . ARCHIDAMUS . Would they else be content to die ? CAMILLO . Yes , if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live . ARCHIDAMUS . If the king had no son , they would desire to live on crutches till he had one . -LSB- Exeunt . -RSB- SCENE II . The same . A Room of State in the Palace . -LSB- Enter LEONTES , POLIXENES , HERMIONE , MAMILLIUS , CAMILLO , and Attendants . -RSB- POLIXENES . Nine changes of the watery star hath been The shepherd 's note since we have left our throne Without a burden : time as long again Would be fill 'd up , my brother , with our thanks ; And yet we should , for perpetuity , Go hence in debt : and therefore , like a cipher , Yet standing in rich place , I multiply With one we-thank-you many thousands more That go before it . LEONTES . Stay your thanks a while , And pay them when you part . POLIXENES . Sir , that 's to-morrow . I am question 'd by my fears , of what may chance Or breed upon our absence ; that may blow No sneaping winds at home , to make us say , ` This is put forth too truly . ' Besides , I have stay 'd To tire your royalty . LEONTES . We are tougher , brother , Than you can put us to ` t. POLIXENES . No longer stay . LEONTES . One seven-night longer . POLIXENES . Very sooth , to-morrow . LEONTES . We 'll part the time between 's then : and in that I 'll no gainsaying . POLIXENES . Press me not , beseech you , so , There is no tongue that moves , none , none i ' the world , So soon as yours , could win me : so it should now , Were there necessity in your request , although ` Twere needful I denied it . My affairs Do even drag me homeward : which to hinder , Were , in your love a whip to me ; my stay To you a charge and trouble : to save both , Farewell , our brother . LEONTES . Tongue-tied , our queen ? Speak you . HERMIONE . I had thought , sir , to have held my peace until You had drawn oaths from him not to stay . You , sir , Charge him too coldly . Tell him you are sure All in Bohemia 's well : this satisfaction The by-gone day proclaimed : say this to him , He 's beat from his best ward . LEONTES . Well said , Hermione . HERMIONE . To tell he longs to see his son were strong : But let him say so then , and let him go ; But let him swear so , and he shall not stay , We 'll thwack him hence with distaffs . -- -LSB- To POLIXENES -RSB- Yet of your royal presence I 'll adventure The borrow of a week . When at Bohemia You take my lord , I 'll give him my commission To let him there a month behind the gest Prefix 'd for 's parting : -- yet , good deed , Leontes , I love thee not a jar of the clock behind What lady she her lord . -- You 'll stay ? POLIXENES . No , madam . HERMIONE . Nay , but you will ? POLIXENES . I may not , verily . HERMIONE . Verily ! You put me off with limber vows ; but I , Though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths , Should yet say ` Sir , no going . ' Verily , You shall not go ; a lady 's verily is As potent as a lord 's . Will go yet ? Force me to keep you as a prisoner , Not like a guest : so you shall pay your fees When you depart , and save your thanks . How say you ? My prisoner or my guest ? by your dread ` verily , ' One of them you shall be . POLIXENES . Your guest , then , madam : To be your prisoner should import offending ; Which is for me less easy to commit Than you to punish . HERMIONE . Not your gaoler then , But your kind hostess . Come , I 'll question you Of my lord 's tricks and yours when you were boys . You were pretty lordings then . POLIXENES . We were , fair queen , Two lads that thought there was no more behind But such a day to-morrow as to-day , And to be boy eternal . HERMIONE . Was not my lord the verier wag o ' the two ? POLIXENES . We were as twinn 'd lambs that did frisk i ' the sun And bleat the one at th ' other . What we chang 'd Was innocence for innocence ; we knew not The doctrine of ill-doing , nor dream 'd That any did . Had we pursu 'd that life , And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear 'd With stronger blood , we should have answer 'd heaven Boldly ` Not guilty , ' the imposition clear 'd Hereditary ours . HERMIONE . By this we gather You have tripp 'd since . POLIXENES . O my most sacred lady , Temptations have since then been born to 's ! for In those unfledg 'd days was my wife a girl ; Your precious self had then not cross 'd the eyes Of my young play-fellow . HERMIONE . Grace to boot ! Of this make no conclusion , lest you say Your queen and I are devils : yet , go on ; The offences we have made you do we 'll answer ; If you first sinn 'd with us , and that with us You did continue fault , and that you slipp 'd not With any but with us . LEONTES . Is he won yet ? HERMIONE . He 'll stay , my lord . LEONTES . At my request he would not . Hermione , my dearest , thou never spok ` st To better purpose . HERMIONE . Never ? LEONTES . Never but once . HERMIONE . What ! have I twice said well ? when was ' t before ? I pr ` ythee tell me ; cram 's with praise , and make 's As fat as tame things : one good deed dying tongueless Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that . Our praises are our wages ; you may ride 's With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere With spur we heat an acre . But to the goal : -- My last good deed was to entreat his stay ; What was my first ? it has an elder sister , Or I mistake you : O , would her name were Grace ! But once before I spoke to the purpose -- when ? Nay , let me have ` t ; I long . LEONTES . Why , that was when Three crabb d months had sour 'd themselves to death , Ere I could make thee open thy white hand And clap thyself my love ; then didst thou utter ' I am yours for ever . ' HERMIONE . It is Grace indeed . Why , lo you now , I have spoke to the purpose twice ; The one for ever earn 'd a royal husband ; Th ' other for some while a friend . -LSB- Giving her hand to POLIXENES . -RSB- LEONTES . -LSB- Aside . -RSB- Too hot , too hot ! To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods . I have _ tremor cordis _ on me ; -- my heart dances ; But not for joy , -- not joy . -- This entertainment May a free face put on ; derive a liberty From heartiness , from bounty , fertile bosom , And well become the agent : ' t may , I grant : But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers , As now they are ; and making practis 'd smiles As in a looking-glass ; and then to sigh , as ` twere The mort o ' the deer : O , that is entertainment My bosom likes not , nor my brows , -- Mamillius , Art thou my boy ? MAMILLIUS . Ay , my good lord . LEONTES . I ' fecks ! Why , that 's my bawcock . What ! hast smutch 'd thy nose ? -- They say it is a copy out of mine . Come , captain , We must be neat ; -- not neat , but cleanly , captain : And yet the steer , the heifer , and the calf , Are all call 'd neat . -- -LSB- Observing POLIXENES and HERMIONE -RSB- Still virginalling Upon his palm ? -- How now , you wanton calf ! Art thou my calf ? MAMILLIUS . Yes , if you will , my lord . LEONTES . Thou want ` st a rough pash , and the shoots that I have , To be full like me : -- yet they say we are Almost as like as eggs ; women say so , That will say anything : but were they false As o'er-dy 'd blacks , as wind , as waters , -- false As dice are to be wish 'd by one that fixes No bourn ` twixt his and mine ; yet were it true To say this boy were like me . -- Come , sir page , Look on me with your welkin eye : sweet villain ! Most dear ` st ! my collop ! -- Can thy dam ? -- may ' t be ? Affection ! thy intention stabs the centre : Thou dost make possible things not so held , Communicat ` st with dreams ; -- how can this be ? -- With what 's unreal thou co-active art , And fellow ` st nothing : then 't is very credent Thou mayst co-join with something ; and thou dost , -- And that beyond commission ; and I find it , -- And that to the infection of my brains And hardening of my brows . POLIXENES . What means Sicilia ? HERMIONE . He something seems unsettled . POLIXENES . How ! my lord ! What cheer ? How is ' t with you , best brother ? HERMIONE . You look As if you held a brow of much distraction : Are you mov 'd , my lord ? LEONTES . No , in good earnest . -- How sometimes nature will betray its folly , Its tenderness , and make itself a pastime To harder bosoms ! Looking on the lines Of my boy 's face , methoughts I did recoil Twenty-three years ; and saw myself unbreech 'd , In my green velvet coat ; my dagger muzzled , Lest it should bite its master , and so prove , As ornaments oft do , too dangerous . How like , methought , I then was to this kernel , This squash , this gentleman . -- Mine honest friend , Will you take eggs for money ? MAMILLIUS . No , my lord , I 'll fight . LEONTES . You will ? Why , happy man be 's dole ! -- My brother , Are you so fond of your young prince as we Do seem to be of ours ? POLIXENES . If at home , sir , He 's all my exercise , my mirth , my matter : Now my sworn friend , and then mine enemy ; My parasite , my soldier , statesman , all : He makes a July 's day short as December ; And with his varying childness cures in me Thoughts that would thick my blood . LEONTES . So stands this squire Offic 'd with me . We two will walk , my lord , And leave you to your graver steps . -- Hermione , How thou lov ` st us show in our brother 's welcome ; Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap : Next to thyself and my young rover , he 's Apparent to my heart . HERMIONE . If you would seek us , We are yours i ' the garden . Shall 's attend you there ? LEONTES . To your own bents dispose you : you 'll be found , Be you beneath the sky . -LSB- Aside -RSB- I am angling now . Though you perceive me not how I give line . Go to , go to ! -LSB- Observing POLIXENES and HERMIONE -RSB- How she holds up the neb , the bill to him ! And arms her with the boldness of a wife To her allowing husband ! -LSB- Exeunt POLIXENES , HERMIONE , and Attendants . -RSB- Gone already ! Inch-thick , knee-deep , o'er head and ears a fork 'd one ! -- Go , play , boy , play : -- thy mother plays , and I Play too ; but so disgrac 'd a part , whose issue Will hiss me to my grave : contempt and clamour Will be my knell . -- Go , play , boy , play . -- There have been , Or I am much deceiv 'd , cuckolds ere now ; And many a man there is , even at this present , Now while I speak this , holds his wife by the arm That little thinks she has been sluic 'd in his absence , And his pond fish 'd by his next neighbour , by Sir Smile , his neighbour ; nay , there 's comfort i n't , Whiles other men have gates , and those gates open 'd , As mine , against their will : should all despair That hath revolted wives , the tenth of mankind Would hang themselves . Physic for ' t there 's none ; It is a bawdy planet , that will strike Where 't is predominant ; and 't is powerful , think it , From east , west , north , and south : be it concluded , No barricado for a belly : know ` t ; It will let in and out the enemy With bag and baggage . Many thousand of us Have the disease , and feel ' t not . -- How now , boy ! MAMILLIUS . I am like you , they say . LEONTES . Why , that 's some comfort . -- What ! Camillo there ? CAMILLO . Ay , my good lord . LEONTES . Go play , Mamillius ; thou ` rt an honest man . -- -LSB- Exit MAMILLIUS . -RSB- Camillo , this great sir will yet stay longer . CAMILLO . You had much ado to make his anchor hold : When you cast out , it still came home . LEONTES . Didst note it ? CAMILLO . He would not stay at your petitions ; made His business more material . LEONTES . Didst perceive it ? -- -LSB- Aside . -RSB- They 're here with me already ; whispering , rounding , ` Sicilia is a so-forth . ' 'T is far gone When I shall gust it last . -- How came ` t , Camillo , That he did stay ? CAMILLO . At the good queen 's entreaty . LEONTES . At the queen 's be ` t : ` good ' should be pertinent ; But so it is , it is not . Was this taken By any understanding pate but thine ? For thy conceit is soaking , will draw in More than the common blocks : -- not noted , is ` t , But of the finer natures ? by some severals Of head-piece extraordinary ? lower messes Perchance are to this business purblind ? say . CAMILLO . Business , my lord ! I think most understand Bohemia stays here longer . LEONTES . Ha ! CAMILLO . Stays here longer . LEONTES . Ay , but why ? CAMILLO . To satisfy your highness , and the entreaties Of our most gracious mistress . LEONTES . Satisfy Th ' entreaties of your mistress ! -- satisfy ! -- Let that suffice . I have trusted thee , Camillo , With all the nearest things to my heart , as well My chamber-councils , wherein , priest-like , thou Hast cleans 'd my bosom ; I from thee departed Thy penitent reform 'd : but we have been Deceiv 'd in thy integrity , deceiv 'd In that which seems so . CAMILLO . Be it forbid , my lord ! LEONTES . To bide upo n't , -- thou art not honest ; or , If thou inclin ` st that way , thou art a coward , Which hoxes honesty behind , restraining From course requir 'd ; or else thou must be counted A servant grafted in my serious trust , And therein negligent ; or else a fool That seest a game play 'd home , the rich stake drawn , And tak ` st it all for jest . CAMILLO . My gracious lord , I may be negligent , foolish , and fearful ; In every one of these no man is free , But that his negligence , his folly , fear , Among the infinite doings of the world , Sometime puts forth : in your affairs , my lord , If ever I were wilful-negligent , It was my folly ; if industriously I play 'd the fool , it was my negligence , Not weighing well the end ; if ever fearful To do a thing , where I the issue doubted , Whereof the execution did cry out Against the non-performance , 't was a fear Which oft affects the wisest : these , my lord , Are such allow 'd infirmities that honesty Is never free of . But , beseech your grace , Be plainer with me ; let me know my trespass By its own visage : if I then deny it , 'T is none of mine . LEONTES . Have not you seen , Camillo , -- But that 's past doubt : you have , or your eye-glass Is thicker than a cuckold 's horn , -- or heard , -- For , to a vision so apparent , rumour Can not be mute , -- or thought , -- for cogitation Resides not in that man that does not think it , -- My wife is slippery ? If thou wilt confess , -- Or else be impudently negative , To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought , -- then say My wife 's a hobby-horse ; deserves a name As rank as any flax-wench that puts to Before her troth-plight : say ' t and justify ` t. CAMILLO . I would not be a stander-by to hear My sovereign mistress clouded so , without My present vengeance taken : ` shrew my heart , You never spoke what did become you less Than this ; which to reiterate were sin As deep as that , though true . LEONTES . Is whispering nothing ? Is leaning cheek to cheek ? is meeting noses ? Kissing with inside lip ? Stopping the career Of laughter with a sigh ? -- a note infallible Of breaking honesty ; -- horsing foot on foot ? Skulking in corners ? wishing clocks more swift ; Hours , minutes ; noon , midnight ? and all eyes Blind with the pin and web but theirs , theirs only , That would unseen be wicked ? -- is this nothing ? Why , then the world and all that 's i n't is nothing ; The covering sky is nothing ; Bohemia nothing ; My is nothing ; nor nothing have these nothings , If this be nothing . CAMILLO . Good my lord , be cur 'd Of this diseas 'd opinion , and betimes ; For 't is most dangerous . LEONTES . Say it be , 't is true . CAMILLO . No , no , my lord . LEONTES . It is ; you lie , you lie : I say thou liest , Camillo , and I hate thee ; Pronounce thee a gross lout , a mindless slave ; Or else a hovering temporizer , that Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil , Inclining to them both . -- Were my wife 's liver Infected as her life , she would not live The running of one glass . CAMILLO . Who does infect her ? LEONTES . Why , he that wears her like her medal , hanging About his neck , Bohemia : who -- if I Had servants true about me , that bare eyes To see alike mine honour as their profits , Their own particular thrifts , -- they would do that Which should undo more doing : ay , and thou , His cupbearer , -- whom I from meaner form Have bench 'd and rear 'd to worship ; who mayst see , Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven , How I am galled , -- mightst bespice a cup , To give mine enemy a lasting wink ; Which draught to me were cordial . CAMILLO . Sir , my lord , I could do this ; and that with no rash potion , But with a ling ` ring dram , that should not work Maliciously like poison : but I can not Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress , So sovereignly being honourable . I have lov 'd thee , -- LEONTES . Make that thy question , and go rot ! Dost think I am so muddy , so unsettled , To appoint myself in this vexation ; sully The purity and whiteness of my sheets , -- Which to preserve is sleep ; which being spotted Is goads , thorns , nettles , tails of wasps ; Give scandal to the blood o ' the prince , my son , -- Who I do think is mine , and love as mine , -- Without ripe moving to ` t ? -- Would I do this ? Could man so blench ? CAMILLO . I must believe you , sir : I do ; and will fetch off Bohemia for ` t ; Provided that , when he 's remov 'd , your highness Will take again your queen as yours at first , Even for your son 's sake ; and thereby for sealing The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms Known and allied to yours . LEONTES . Thou dost advise me Even so as I mine own course have set down : I 'll give no blemish to her honour , none . CAMILLO . My lord , Go then ; and with a countenance as clear As friendship wears at feasts , keep with Bohemia And with your queen : I am his cupbearer . If from me he have wholesome beverage , Account me not your servant . LEONTES . This is all : Do ` t , and thou hast the one-half of my heart ; Do ' t not , thou splitt ` st thine own . CAMILLO . I 'll do ` t , my lord . LEONTES . I will seem friendly , as thou hast advis 'd me . -LSB- Exit . -RSB- CAMILLO . O miserable lady ! -- But , for me , What case stand I in ? I must be the poisoner Of good Polixenes : and my ground to do ' t Is the obedience to a master ; one Who , in rebellion with himself , will have All that are his so too . -- To do this deed , Promotion follows : if I could find example Of thousands that had struck anointed kings And flourish 'd after , I 'd not do ` t ; but since Nor brass , nor stone , nor parchment , bears not one , Let villainy itself forswear ` t. I must Forsake the court : to do ` t , or no , is certain To me a break-neck . Happy star reign now ! Here comes Bohemia . -LSB- Enter POLIXENES . -RSB- POLIXENES . This is strange ! methinks My favour here begins to warp . Not speak ? -- Good-day , Camillo . CAMILLO . Hail , most royal sir ! POLIXENES . What is the news i ' the court ? CAMILLO . None rare , my lord . POLIXENES . The king hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province , and a region Lov 'd as he loves himself ; even now I met him With customary compliment ; when he , Wafting his eyes to the contrary , and falling A lip of much contempt , speeds from me ; So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changes thus his manners . CAMILLO . I dare not know , my lord . POLIXENES . How ! dare not ! do not . Do you know , and dare not Be intelligent to me ? 'T is thereabouts ; For , to yourself , what you do know , you must , And can not say , you dare not . Good Camillo , Your chang 'd complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine chang 'd too ; for I must be A party in this alteration , finding Myself thus alter 'd with ` t. CAMILLO . There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper ; but I can not name the disease ; and it is caught Of you that yet are well . POLIXENES . How ! caught of me ! Make me not sighted like the basilisk : I have look 'd on thousands who have sped the better By my regard , but kill 'd none so . Camillo , -- As you are certainly a gentleman , thereto Clerk-like , experienc 'd , which no less adorns Our gentry than our parents ' noble names , In whose success we are gentle , -- I beseech you , If you know aught which does behove my knowledge Thereof to be inform 'd , impriso n't not In ignorant concealment . CAMILLO . I may not answer . POLIXENES . A sickness caught of me , and yet I well ! I must be answer 'd . -- Dost thou hear , Camillo , I conjure thee , by all the parts of man Which honour does acknowledge , -- whereof the least Is not this suit of mine , -- that thou declare What incidency thou dost guess of harm Is creeping toward me ; how far off , how near ; Which way to be prevented , if to be ; If not , how best to bear it . CAMILLO . Sir , I will tell you ; Since I am charg 'd in honour , and by him That I think honourable : therefore mark my counsel , Which must be ev 'n as swiftly follow 'd as I mean to utter it , or both yourself and me Cry lost , and so goodnight ! POLIXENES . On , good Camillo . CAMILLO . I am appointed him to murder you . POLIXENES . By whom , Camillo ? CAMILLO . By the king . POLIXENES . For what ? CAMILLO . He thinks , nay , with all confidence he swears , As he had see n't or been an instrument To vice you to ` t , that you have touch 'd his queen Forbiddenly . POLIXENES . O , then my best blood turn To an infected jelly , and my name Be yok 'd with his that did betray the best ! Turn then my freshest reputation to A savour that may strike the dullest nostril Where I arrive , and my approach be shunn 'd , Nay , hated too , worse than the great ` st infection That e'er was heard or read ! CAMILLO . Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their influences , you may as well Forbid the sea for to obey the moon As , or by oath remove , or counsel shake The fabric of his folly , whose foundation Is pil 'd upon his faith , and will continue The standing of his body . POLIXENES . How should this grow ? CAMILLO . I know not : but I am sure 't is safer to Avoid what 's grown than question how 't is born . If , therefore you dare trust my honesty , -- That lies enclos d in this trunk , which you Shall bear along impawn 'd , -- away to-night . Your followers I will whisper to the business ; And will , by twos and threes , at several posterns , Clear them o ' the city : for myself , I 'll put My fortunes to your service , which are here By this discovery lost . Be not uncertain ; For , by the honour of my parents , I Have utter 'd truth : which if you seek to prove , I dare not stand by ; nor shall you be safer Than one condemn 'd by the king 's own mouth , thereon His execution sworn . POLIXENES . I do believe thee ; I saw his heart in his face . Give me thy hand ; Be pilot to me , and thy places shall Still neighbour mine . My ships are ready , and My people did expect my hence departure Two days ago . -- This jealousy Is for a precious creature : as she 's rare , Must it be great ; and , as his person 's mighty , Must it be violent ; and as he does conceive He is dishonour 'd by a man which ever Profess 'd to him , why , his revenges must In that be made more bitter . Fear o'ershades me ; Good expedition be my friend , and comfort The gracious queen , part of this theme , but nothing Of his ill-ta ` en suspicion ! Come , Camillo ; I will respect thee as a father , if Thou bear ` st my life off hence : let us avoid . CAMILLO . It is in mine authority to command The keys of all the posterns : please your highness To take the urgent hour : come , sir , away . -LSB- Exeunt . -RSB- ACT II . SCENE I. Sicilia . A Room in the Palace . -LSB- Enter HERMIONE , MAMILLIUS , and Ladies . -RSB- HERMIONE . Take the boy to you : he so troubles me , 'T is past enduring . FIRST LADY . Come , my gracious lord , Shall I be your playfellow ? MAMILLIUS . No , I 'll none of you . FIRST LADY . Why , my sweet lord ? MAMILLIUS . You 'll kiss me hard , and speak to me as if I were a baby still . -- -LSB- To Second Lady . -RSB- I love you better . SECOND LADY . And why so , my lord ? MAMILLIUS . Not for because Your brows are blacker ; yet black brows , they say , Become some women best ; so that there be not Too much hair there , but in a semicircle Or a half-moon made with a pen . SECOND LADY . Who taught you this ? MAMILLIUS . I learn 'd it out of women 's faces . -- Pray now , What colour are your eyebrows ? FIRST LADY . Blue , my lord . MAMILLIUS . Nay , that 's a mock : I have seen a lady 's nose That has been blue , but not her eyebrows . FIRST LADY . Hark ye : The queen your mother rounds apace . We shall Present our services to a fine new prince One of these days ; and then you 'd wanton with us , If we would have you . SECOND LADY . She is spread of late Into a goodly bulk : good time encounter her ! HERMIONE . What wisdom stirs amongst you ? Come , sir , now I am for you again : pray you sit by us , And tell 's a tale . MAMILLIUS . Merry or sad shall ' t be ? HERMIONE . As merry as you will . MAMILLIUS . A sad tale 's best for winter . I have one Of sprites and goblins . HERMIONE . Let 's have that , good sir . Come on , sit down ; -- come on , and do your best To fright me with your sprites : you 're powerful at it . MAMILLIUS . There was a man , -- HERMIONE . Nay , come , sit down : then on . MAMILLIUS . Dwelt by a churchyard : -- I will tell it softly ; Yond crickets shall not hear it . HERMIONE . Come on then , And give ' t me in mine ear . -LSB- Enter LEONTES , ANTIGONUS , Lords , and Guards . -RSB- LEONTES . Was he met there ? his train ? Camillo with him ? FIRST LORD . Behind the tuft of pines I met them ; never Saw I men scour so on their way : I ey 'd them Even to their ships . LEONTES . How bles 'd am I In my just censure , in my true opinion ! -- Alack , for lesser knowledge ! -- How accurs 'd In being so blest ! -- There may be in the cup A spider steep 'd , and one may drink , depart , And yet partake no venom ; for his knowledge Is not infected ; but if one present The abhorr 'd ingredient to his eye , make known How he hath drunk , he cracks his gorge , his sides , With violent hefts ; -- I have drunk , and seen the spider . Camillo was his help in this , his pander : -- There is a plot against my life , my crown ; All 's true that is mistrusted : -- that false villain Whom I employ 'd , was pre-employ 'd by him : He has discover 'd my design , and I Remain a pinch 'd thing ; yea , a very trick For them to play at will . -- How came the posterns So easily open ? FIRST LORD . By his great authority ; Which often hath no less prevail 'd than so , On your command . LEONTES . I know ' t too well . -- Give me the boy : -- I am glad you did not nurse him : Though he does bear some signs of me , yet you Have too much blood in him . HERMIONE . What is this ? sport ? LEONTES . Bear the boy hence ; he shall not come about her ; Away with him ! -- and let her sport herself With that she 's big with ; -- for 't is Polixenes Has made thee swell thus . -LSB- Exit MAMILLIUS , with some of the Guards . -RSB- HERMIONE . But I 'd say he had not , And I 'll be sworn you would believe my saying , Howe'er you learn the nayward . LEONTES . You , my lords , Look on her , mark her well ; be but about To say , ` she is a goodly lady ' and The justice of your hearts will thereto add , '' ","i":0}],"patient":[{"w":"Enter","i":774},{"w":"discovers","i":32578},{"w":"art","i":32645}],"g":1,"id":15,"poss":[{"w":"hand","i":2018},{"w":"husband","i":2926},{"w":"well","i":6845},{"w":"but","i":6883},{"w":"form","i":6887},{"w":"jewel","i":30760},{"w":"posture","i":32620}]},{"agent":[],"NNPcount":2,"names":[{"c":2,"n":"Mark"}],"mod":[],"speaking":[],"patient":[],"g":2,"id":16,"poss":[]},{"agent":[{"w":"included","i":50},{"w":"included","i":35114}],"NNPcount":4,"names":[{"c":2,"n":"Project Gutenberg License"},{"c":2,"n":"Project Gutenberg"}],"mod":[{"w":"trademark","i":34256}],"speaking":[],"patient":[],"g":0,"id":17,"poss":[]}],"id":"The_Winter's_Tale_William_Shakespeare"}
