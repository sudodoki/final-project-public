She lived in a small town with her brother , who was a curate . Both had recently come into the country . They came nobody knew whence ; but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious , nobody thought of asking whence they came . They were said , however , to be of good extraction . My friend , who was seigneur of the country , might have seduced her , or taken her by force , at his will -- for he was master .
