When introduc 'd , our presents first we bring , Then crave an instant audience from the king . His leave obtain 'd , our native soil we name , And tell th ' important cause for which we came . Attentively he heard us , while we spoke ; Then , with soft accents , and a pleasing look , Made this return : ` Ausonian race , of old Renown 'd for peace , and for an age of gold , What madness has your alter 'd minds possess 'd , To change for war hereditary rest , Solicit arms unknown , and tempt the sword , A needless ill your ancestors abhorr 'd ? We - for myself I speak , and all the name Of Grecians , who to Troy 's destruction came , Omitting those who were in battle slain , Or borne by rolling Simois to the main - Not one but suffer 'd , and too dearly bought The prize of honor which in arms he sought ; Some doom 'd to death , and some in exile driv ` n. Outcasts , abandon 'd by the care of Heav ` n ; So worn , so wretched , so despis 'd a crew , As ev 'n old Priam might with pity view .

Ulysses with his men Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops ' den . Why should I name Idomeneus , in vain Restor 'd to scepters , and expell 'd again ? Or young Achilles , by his rival slain ? Ev 'n he , the King of Men , the foremost name Of all the Greeks , and most renown 'd by fame , The proud revenger of another 's wife , Yet by his own adult ` ress lost his life ; Fell at his threshold ; and the spoils of Troy The foul polluters of his bed enjoy .

The long defense the Trojan people made , The war protracted , and the siege delay 'd , Were due to Hector 's and this hero 's hand : Both brave alike , and equal in command ; Aeneas , not inferior in the field , In pious reverence to the gods excell 'd .

But , O ! if any ancient blood remains , One drop of all our fathers ' , in our veins , That man would I prefer before the rest , Who dar 'd his death with an undaunted breast ; Who comely fell , by no dishonest wound , To shun that sight , and , dying , gnaw 'd the ground . But , if we still have fresh recruits in store , If our confederates can afford us more ; If the contended field we bravely fought , And not a bloodless victory was bought ; Their losses equal 'd ours ; and , for their slain , With equal fires they fill 'd the shining plain ; Why thus , unforc 'd , should we so tamely yield , And , ere the trumpet sounds , resign the field ?

That Turnus is permitted still to live , To whom his birth a god and goddess give ! But yet is just and lawful for your line To drive their fields , and force with fraud to join ; Realms , not your own , among your clans divide , And from the bridegroom tear the promis 'd bride ; Petition , while you public arms prepare ; Pretend a peace , and yet provoke a war ! ' T was giv 'n to you , your darling son to shroud , To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd , And , for a man , obtend an empty cloud . From flaming fleets you turn 'd the fire away , And chang 'd the ships to daughters of the sea . But is my crime - the Queen of Heav 'n offends , If she presume to save her suff ` ring friends ! Your son , not knowing what his foes decree , You say , is absent : absent let him be . Yours is Cythera , yours the Cyprian tow ` rs , The soft recesses , and the sacred bow ` rs . Why do you then these needless arms prepare , And thus provoke a people prone to war ? Did I with fire the Trojan town deface , Or hinder from return your exil 'd race ? Was I the cause of mischief , or the man Whose lawless lust the fatal war began ? Think on whose faith th ' adult ` rous youth relied ; Who promis 'd , who procur 'd , the Spartan bride ? When all th ' united states of Greece combin 'd , To purge the world of the perfidious kind , Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate : Your quarrels and complaints are now too late .
