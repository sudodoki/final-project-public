And there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all -- his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately , which might have been Edward 's , on proper conditions .

Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well .

The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived .

But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank .

From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her . She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . '' ","i":29873},{"w":"`` I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct .

I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; '' ","i":48457},{"w":"`` You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual . -- He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible .

I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to - ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence .

This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment !

This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ?

'' ","i":75999},{"w":"`` His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self-reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others .

'' ","i":76525},{"w":"`` I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct .

I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH .

Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you .

I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better . Dorsetshire !

There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ? ' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , ` My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy . The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon . ' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . We measured the dining-room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan .

To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language -- a thunderbolt . -- Thunderbolts and daggers ! -- what a reproof would she have given me ! -- her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own , -- and I am sure they are dearer .

To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him ? -- Did you allow him to hope ? '' ","i":125234},{"w":"`` No . -- He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed ; -- and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance . -- There was always a something , -- if you remember , -- in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like .

Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that -- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage ? -- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ?

His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ? -- The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . '' ","i":130484},{"w":"`` One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams .

When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before . Your sister 's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind -- It is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what SHE was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . '' ","i":117862},{"w":"`` It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer .

'' ","i":118106},{"w":"`` I insist on you hearing the whole of it , '' ","i":118159},{"w":"`` My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . Every year since my coming of age , or even before , I believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , Mrs. Smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of ; -- and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty -- which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much -- I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it . -- But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love . But have I ever known it ? -- Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice ? -- or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers ? -- But I have done it . To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing . '' ","i":118174},{"w":"`` To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness ! -- Is there a man on earth who could have done it ? -- Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless . Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed . I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound . The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever . At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display . But in the interim -- in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private -- a circumstance occurred -- an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort . A discovery took place , '' ","i":118500},{"w":"`` Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain myself farther , '' ","i":118805},{"w":"`` your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago .

I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me . I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint . If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding -- I do not mean , however , to defend myself . Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self-reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . I wish -- I heartily wish it had never been . But I have injured more than herself ; and I have injured one , whose affection for me -- -LRB- may I say it ? -RRB- was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind -- Oh ! how infinitely superior !

Miss Dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery . I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now . Well , I went , left all that I loved , and went to those to whom , at best , I was only indifferent .

He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night !

'' ","i":39111},{"w":"`` Yet I hardly know how , '' ","i":43681},{"w":"`` unless it had been under totally different circumstances .

I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . '' ","i":52938},{"w":"`` I thank you , ma'am , sincerely thank you , '' ","i":54779},{"w":"`` your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother , -- I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . '' ","i":54797},{"w":"`` I am delighted with the plan , '' ","i":55233},{"w":"`` it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other .

Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men 's going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I wo n't disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her .

And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised ! -- Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation .

'' ","i":96115},{"w":"`` What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered , when first Fanny broke it to her , is not to be described . While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person ! -- such a suspicion could never have entered her head ! If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter . ` THERE , to be sure , ' said she , ' I might have thought myself safe . ' She was quite in an agony . We consulted together , however , as to what should be done , and at last she determined to send for Edward . He came . But I am sorry to relate what ensued . All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny 's entreaties , was of no avail . Duty , affection , every thing was disregarded . I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before . His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land-tax , brings in a good thousand a-year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it .

She is a good-hearted girl as ever lived . -- Very well upon my word . That sentence is very prettily turned . Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough .

'' ","i":79549},{"w":"`` Ah ! poor dear , '' ","i":86276},{"w":"`` That is exactly what I said , my dear . ` Lord ! ' says I , ` is Mrs. Dashwood ill ? ' So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this . Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about -LRB- but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it -RRB- , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy ! -- There 's for you , my dear ! -- And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy ! -- Could you have believed such a thing possible ? -- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it ! -- THAT is strange ! -- I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter ; -- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well-meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . ` Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ` they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on . Poor soul ! I pity HER . And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan , and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar . The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . Lord ! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it ! To have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion ! -- and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same . He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care . I have no pity for either of them . I have no notion of people 's making such a to-do about money and greatness . There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord ! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . '' ","i":93340},{"w":"`` Yes , ma'am . '' ","i":96364},{"w":"`` Then , '' ","i":97268},{"w":"`` he has acted like an honest man ! I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal . I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . '' ","i":97286},{"w":"`` Well , sir , '' ","i":97606},{"w":"`` and how did it end ? '' ","i":97616},{"w":"`` Poor young man ! '' ","i":97827},{"w":"`` I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . '' ","i":97837},{"w":"`` Well ! '' ","i":98038},{"w":"`` that is HER revenge . Everybody has a way of their own . But I do n't think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me . '' ","i":98046},{"w":"`` Ah ! Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods ; '' ","i":102638},{"w":"`` for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers ; -- and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back ! -- Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats .

'' ","i":104043},{"w":"`` This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . His marriage must still be a distant good ; -- at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon . -- '' ","i":104124},{"w":"`` Well , Miss Dashwood , '' ","i":104359},{"w":"`` Opportunity !

'' ","i":104590},{"w":"`` Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out . But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it . '' ","i":104793},{"w":"`` Oh ! very well , '' ","i":104911},{"w":"`` No , ma'am , not even Lucy if you please . One day 's delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . I shall do THAT directly . It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . '' ","i":104948},{"w":"`` Oh , ho ! -- I understand you . Mr. Ferrars is to be the man . Well , so much the better for him . Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? Should not the Colonel write himself ? -- sure , he is the proper person . '' ","i":105076},{"w":"`` And so YOU are forced to do it .

I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed . '' ","i":105216},{"w":"`` I have just been thinking of Betty 's sister , my dear . I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . But whether she would do for a lady 's maid , I am sure I ca n't tell . She is an excellent housemaid , and works very well at her needle . However , you will think of all that at your leisure . '' ","i":105295},{"w":"`` Two or three months ! '' ","i":107065},{"w":"`` Lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months !
