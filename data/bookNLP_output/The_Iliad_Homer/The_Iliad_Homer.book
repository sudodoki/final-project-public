All these things will he give you now down , and if hereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam , you can come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil , and load your ship with gold and bronze to your liking . You can take twenty Trojan women , the loveliest after Helen herself . Then , when we reach Achaean Argos , wealthiest of all lands , you shall be his son-in-law , and he will show you like honour with his own dear son Orestes , who is being nurtured in all abundance . Agamemnon has three daughters , Chrysothemis , Laodice , and Iphianassa ; you may take the one of your choice , freely and without gifts of wooing , to the house of Peleus ; he will add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter , and will give you seven well-established cities , Cardamyle , Enope , and Hire where there is grass ; holy Pheras and the rich meadows of Anthea ; Aepea also , and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus , all near the sea , and on the borders of sandy Pylos . The men that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep ; they will honour you with gifts as though were a god , and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances . All this will he do if you will now forgo your anger . Moreover , though you hate both him and his gifts with all your heart , yet pity the rest of the Achaeans who are being harassed in all their host ; they will honour you as a god , and you will earn great glory at their hands . You might even kill Hector ; he will come within your reach , for he is infatuated , and declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have brought can hold his own against him .

Thereon the elders of the Aetolians besought Meleager ; they sent the chiefest of their priests , and begged him to come out and help them , promising him a great reward . They bade him choose fifty plough-gates , the most fertile in the plain of Calydon , the one-half vineyard and the other open plough-land . The old warrior Oeneus implored him , standing at the threshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication . His sisters and his mother herself besought him sore , but he the more refused them ; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to him also prayed him , but they could not move him till the foe was battering at the very doors of his chamber , and the Curetes had scaled the walls and were setting fire to the city . Then at last his sorrowing wife detailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken ; she reminded him how the men are slain , and the city is given over to the flames , while the women and children are carried into captivity ; when he heard all this , his heart was touched , and he donned his armour to go forth . Thus of his own inward motion he saved the city of the Aetolians ; but they now gave him nothing of those rich rewards that they had offered earlier , and though he saved the city he took nothing by it . Be not then , my son , thus minded ; let not heaven lure you into any such course . When the ships are burning it will be a harder matter to save them . Take the gifts , and go , for the Achaeans will then honour you as a god ; whereas if you fight without taking them , you may beat the battle back , but you will not be held in like honour .

Love him so well , and you may lose the love I bear you . You ought to help me rather in troubling those that trouble me ; be king as much as I am , and share like honour with myself ; the others shall take my answer ; stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed ; at daybreak we will consider whether to remain or go .

Have you anything to say to the Myrmidons or to myself ? or have you had news from Phthia which you alone know ? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is still alive , as also Peleus son of Aeacus , among the Myrmidons -- men whose loss we two should bitterly deplore ; or are you grieving about the Argives and the way in which they are being killed at the ships , through their own high-handed doings ? Do not hide anything from me but tell me that both of us may know about it . '' ","i":106162},{"w":"`` What , noble Patroclus , are you saying ? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding , nor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove , but I am cut to the very heart that one of my own rank should dare to rob me because he is more powerful than I am . This , after all that I have gone through , is more than I can endure . The girl whom the sons of the Achaeans chose for me , whom I won as the fruit of my spear on having sacked a city -- her has King Agamemnon taken from me as though I were some common vagrant . Still , let bygones be bygones : no man may keep his anger for ever ; I said I would not relent till battle and the cry of war had reached my own ships ; nevertheless , now gird my armour about your shoulders , and lead the Myrmidons to battle , for the dark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet ; the Argives are driven back on to the beach , cooped within a narrow space , and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out against them , because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near them . Had they seen this , there would not have been a creek nor grip that had not been filled with their dead as they fled back again . And so it would have been , if only King Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me . As it is the Trojans have beset our host . Diomed son of Tydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the Danaans , neither have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hated head , whereas that of murderous Hector rings in my cars as he gives orders to the Trojans , who triumph over the Achaeans and fill the whole plain with their cry of battle . But even so , Patroclus , fall upon them and save the fleet , lest the Trojans fire it and prevent us from being able to return . Do , however , as I now bid you , that you may win me great honour from all the Danaans , and that they may restore the girl to me again and give me rich gifts into the bargain . When you have driven the Trojans from the ships , come back again . Though Juno 's thundering husband should put triumph within your reach , do not fight the Trojans further in my absence , or you will rob me of glory that should be mine . And do not for lust of battle go on killing the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius , lest one of the ever-living gods from Olympus attack you -- for Phoebus Apollo loves them well : return when you have freed the ships from peril , and let others wage war upon the plain . Would , by father Jove , Minerva , and Apollo , that not a single man of all the Trojans might be left alive , nor yet of the Argives , but that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle that veils the brow of Troy .

You keep us here at the ships against our will ; if you are so relentless it were better we went home over the sea . ' Often have you gathered and thus chided with me .

Would that you were still dwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs , and that Peleus had taken to himself some mortal bride . For now you shall have grief infinite by reason of the death of that son whom you can never welcome home -- nay , I will not live nor go about among mankind unless Hector fall by my spear , and thus pay me for having slain Patroclus son of Menoetius .

Therefore , perish strife both from among gods and men , and anger , wherein even a righteous man will harden his heart -- which rises up in the soul of a man like smoke , and the taste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey . Even so has Agamemnon angered me . And yet -- so be it , for it is over ; I will force my soul into subjection as I needs must ; I will go ; I will pursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved so dearly , and will then abide my doom when it may please Jove and the other gods to send it . Even Hercules , the best beloved of Jove -- even he could not escape the hand of death , but fate and Juno 's fierce anger laid him low , as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom awaits me . Till then I will win fame , and will bid Trojan and Dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both their hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow ; thus shall they know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer .

Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector was killing the Argives at their ships , and all the time I kept thinking of Folly who had so baned me . I was blind , and Jove robbed me of my reason ; I will now make atonement , and will add much treasure by way of amends . Go , therefore , into battle , you and your people with you .

His horses are the finest and strongest that I have ever seen , they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any wind that blows .

Now that my folly has destroyed the host , I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan women in the face , lest a worse man should say , ` Hector has ruined us by his self-confidence .

Many a son of mine has he slain in the flower of his youth , and yet , grieve for these as I may , I do so for one -- Hector -- more than for them all , and the bitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades .

Apollo killed the sons with arrows from his silver bow , to punish Niobe , and Diana slew the daughters , because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto ; she said Leto had borne two children only , whereas she had herself borne many -- whereon the two killed the many . Nine days did they lie weltering , and there was none to bury them , for the son of Saturn turned the people into stone ; but on the tenth day the gods in heaven themselves buried them , and Niobe then took food , being worn out with weeping . They say that somewhere among the rocks on the mountain pastures of Sipylus , where the nymphs live that haunt the river Achelous , there , they say , she lives in stone and still nurses the sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven .

'' ","i":74200},{"w":"`` Such was I among my peers , as surely as ever was , but Achilles is for keeping all his valour for himself ; bitterly will he rue it hereafter when the host is being cut to pieces . My good friend , did not Menoetius charge you thus , on the day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon ? Ulysses and I were in the house , inside , and heard all that he said to you ; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits throughout all Achaea , and when we got there we found Menoetius and yourself , and Achilles with you . The old knight Peleus was in the outer court , roasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Jove the lord of thunder ; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which he poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice . You two were busy cutting up the heifer , and at that moment we stood at the gates , whereon Achilles sprang to his feet , led us by the hand into the house , placed us at table , and set before us such hospitable entertainment as guests expect . When we had satisfied ourselves with meat and drink , I said my say and urged both of you to join us . You were ready enough to do so , and the two old men charged you much and straitly . Old Peleus bade his son Achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie his peers , while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus to you : ` My son , ' said he , ` Achilles is of nobler birth than you are , but you are older than he , though he is far the better man of the two . Counsel him wisely , guide him in the right way , and he will follow you to his own profit . ' Thus did your father charge you , but you have forgotten ; nevertheless , even now , say all this to Achilles if he will listen to you . Who knows but with heaven 's help you may talk him over , for it is good to take a friend 's advice . If , however , he is fearful about some oracle , or if his mother has told him something from Jove , then let him send you , and let the rest of the Myrmidons follow with you , if perchance you may bring light and saving to the Danaans . And let him send you into battle clad in his own armour , that the Trojans may mistake you for him and leave off fighting ; the sons of the Achaeans may thus have time to get their breath , for they are hard pressed and there is little breathing time in battle . You , who are fresh , might easily drive a tired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents and ships . '' ","i":75986},{"w":"`` It is indeed as you say ; it is all coming true at this moment , and even Jove who thunders from on high can not prevent it . Fallen is the wall on which we relied as an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet . The Trojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships ; look where you may you can not see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming ; they are being killed in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends to heaven ; let us think , if counsel can be of any use , what we had better do ; but I do not advise our going into battle ourselves , for a man can not fight when he is wounded . '' ","i":92398},{"w":"`` Father Jove , '' ","i":101816},{"w":"`` if ever any one in wheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer and prayed that he might return safely home , whereon you bowed your head to him in assent , bear it in mind now , and suffer not the Trojans to triumph thus over the Achaeans . '' ","i":101824},{"w":"`` Alas , '' ","i":124473},{"w":"`` son of noble Peleus , I bring you bad tidings , would indeed that they were untrue . Patroclus has fallen , and a fight is raging about his naked body -- for Hector holds his armour .

Grief greater than this I could not know , not even though I were to hear of the death of my father , who is now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son , who am here fighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake of Helen , nor yet though I should hear that my son is no more -- he who is being brought up in Scyros -- if indeed Neoptolemus is still living . Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away from Argos , while you were to return to Phthia , bring back my son with you in your own ship , and show him all my property , my bondsmen , and the greatness of my house -- for Peleus must surely be either dead , or what little life remains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities of age and ever present fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my death . '' ","i":134440},{"w":"`` Antilochus , '' ","i":158034},{"w":"`` you are young , but Jove and Neptune have loved you well , and have made you an excellent horseman . I need not therefore say much by way of instruction . You are skilful at wheeling your horses round the post , but the horses themselves are very slow , and it is this that will , I fear , mar your chances . The other drivers know less than you do , but their horses are fleeter ; therefore , my dear son , see if you can not hit upon some artifice whereby you may insure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers . The woodman does more by skill than by brute force ; by skill the pilot guides his storm-tossed barque over the sea , and so by skill one driver can beat another . If a man go wide in rounding this way and that , whereas a man who knows what he is doing may have worse horses , but he will keep them well in hand when he sees the doubling-post ; he knows the precise moment at which to pull the rein , and keeps his eye well on the man in front of him . I will give you this certain token which can not escape your notice . There is a stump of a dead tree -- oak or pine as it may be -- some six feet above the ground , and not yet rotted away by rain ; it stands at the fork of the road ; it has two white stones set one on each side , and there is a clear course all round it . It may have been a monument to some one long since dead , or it may have been used as a doubling-post in days gone by ; now , however , it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark round which the chariots shall turn ; hug it as close as you can , but as you stand in your chariot lean over a little to the left ; urge on your right-hand horse with voice and lash , and give him a loose rein , but let the left-hand horse keep so close in , that the nave of your wheel shall almost graze the post ; but mind the stone , or you will wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces , which would be sport for others but confusion for yourself . Therefore , my dear son , mind well what you are about , for if you can be first to round the post there is no chance of any one giving you the go-by later , not even though you had Adrestus 's horse Arion behind you -- a horse which is of divine race -- or those of Laomedon , which are the noblest in this country . '' ","i":158041},{"w":"`` My son , all that you have said is true ; there is no strength now in my legs and feet , nor can I hit out with my hands from either shoulder . Would that I were still young and strong as when the Epeans were burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium , and his sons offered prizes in his honour . There was then none that could vie with me neither of the Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians . In boxing I overcame Clytomedes son of Enops , and in wrestling , Ancaeus of Pleuron who had come forward against me . Iphiclus was a good runner , but I beat him , and threw farther with my spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus . In chariot-racing alone did the two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding their horses in front of me , for they were angry at the way victory had gone , and at the greater part of the prizes remaining in the place in which they had been offered . They were twins , and the one kept on holding the reins , and holding the reins , while the other plied the whip . Such was I then , but now I must leave these matters to younger men ; I must bow before the weight of years , but in those days I was eminent among heroes . And now , sir , go on with the funeral contests in honour of your comrade : gladly do I accept this urn , and my heart rejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill towards you , and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans . For all which may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance .

I say further , and lay my saying to your heart , if ever I want to sack a city belonging to friends of yours , you must not try to stop me ; you will have to let me do it , for I am giving in to you sorely against my will .

See how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods .

Then there was the daughter of Phoenix , who bore me Minos and Rhadamanthus : there was Semele , and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot my lion-hearted son Hercules , while Semele became mother to Bacchus the comforter of mankind .
