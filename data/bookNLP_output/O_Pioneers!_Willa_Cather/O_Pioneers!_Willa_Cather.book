But when we got home , my aunt scolded him for buying toys when she needed so many things . We wound our lady up every night , and when she began to move her head my aunt used to laugh as hard as any of us .

I thought that day there was some kind of feeling , something unusual , between them . I meant to talk to you about it .

'' ","i":65826},{"w":"`` Suppose I do will my land to their children , what difference will that make ? The land belongs to the future , Carl ; that 's the way it seems to me . How many of the names on the county clerk 's plat will be there in fifty years ? I might as well try to will the sunset over there to my brother 's children . We come and go , but the land is always here . And the people who love it and understand it are the people who own it -- for a little while .

Our people were better people than these in the old country . We OUGHT to do more than they do , and see further ahead . Yes , mother , I 'm going to clear the table now .

But off there in the cities there are thousands of rolling stones like me . We are all alike ; we have no ties , we know nobody , we own nothing . When one of us dies , they scarcely know where to bury him . Our landlady and the delicatessen man are our mourners , and we leave nothing behind us but a frock-coat and a fiddle , or an easel , or a typewriter , or whatever tool we got our living by . All we have ever managed to do is to pay our rent , the exorbitant rent that one has to pay for a few square feet of space near the heart of things . We have no house , no place , no people of our own . We live in the streets , in the parks , in the theatres . We sit in restaurants and concert halls and look about at the hundreds of our own kind and shudder .

You must feel when people admire you . '' ","i":28982},{"w":"`` Well , sometimes . The men in town , at the banks and the county offices , seem glad to see me . I think , myself , it is more pleasant to do business with people who are clean and healthy-looking , '' ","i":29088},{"w":"`` That 's one thing I like about Germans ; they make an orchard grow if they ca n't make anything else . I 'm so glad these trees belong to some one who takes comfort in them .
