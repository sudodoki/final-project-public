In the course of things we may expect that , if I live , I shall one day or other be your landlord ; indeed , it is on the ground of that expectation that my grandfather has wished me to celebrate this day and to come among you now ; and I look forward to this position , not merely as one of power and pleasure for myself , but as a means of benefiting my neighbours . It hardly becomes so young a man as I am to talk much about farming to you , who are most of you so much older , and are men of experience ; still , I have interested myself a good deal in such matters , and learned as much about them as my opportunities have allowed ; and when the course of events shall place the estate in my hands , it will be my first desire to afford my tenants all the encouragement a landlord can give them , in improving their land and trying to bring about a better practice of husbandry . It will be my wish to be looked on by all my deserving tenants as their best friend , and nothing would make me so happy as to be able to respect every man on the estate , and to be respected by him in return . It is not my place at present to enter into particulars ; I only meet your good hopes concerning me by telling you that my own hopes correspond to them -- that what you expect from me I desire to fulfil ; and I am quite of Mr. Poyser 's opinion , that when a man has said what he means , he had better stop . But the pleasure I feel in having my own health drunk by you would not be perfect if we did not drink the health of my grandfather , who has filled the place of both parents to me .

I think there can be no man here who has not a respect , and some of you , I am sure , have a very high regard , for my friend Adam Bede . It is well known to every one in this neighbourhood that there is no man whose word can be more depended on than his ; that whatever he undertakes to do , he does well , and is as careful for the interests of those who employ him as for his own . I 'm proud to say that I was very fond of Adam when I was a little boy , and I have never lost my old feeling for him -- I think that shows that I know a good fellow when I find him . It has long been my wish that he should have the management of the woods on the estate , which happen to be very valuable , not only because I think so highly of his character , but because he has the knowledge and the skill which fit him for the place . And I am happy to tell you that it is my grandfather 's wish too , and it is now settled that Adam shall manage the woods -- a change which I am sure will be very much for the advantage of the estate ; and I hope you will by and by join me in drinking his health , and in wishing him all the prosperity in life that he deserves . But there is a still older friend of mine than Adam Bede present , and I need not tell you that it is Mr. Irwine . I 'm sure you will agree with me that we must drink no other person 's health until we have drunk his . I know you have all reason to love him , but no one of his parishioners has so much reason as I. Come , charge your glasses , and let us drink to our excellent rector -- three times three !

Indeed , our pleasant meeting to-day is a proof that when what is good comes of age and is likely to live , there is reason for rejoicing , and the relation between us as clergyman and parishioners came of age two years ago , for it is three-and-twenty years since I first came among you , and I see some tall fine-looking young men here , as well as some blooming young women , that were far from looking as pleasantly at me when I christened them as I am happy to see them looking now . But I 'm sure you will not wonder when I say that among all those young men , the one in whom I have the strongest interest is my friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne , for whom you have just expressed your regard . I had the pleasure of being his tutor for several years , and have naturally had opportunities of knowing him intimately which can not have occurred to any one else who is present ; and I have some pride as well as pleasure in assuring you that I share your high hopes concerning him , and your confidence in his possession of those qualities which will make him an excellent landlord when the time shall come for him to take that important position among you . We feel alike on most matters on which a man who is getting towards fifty can feel in common with a young man of one-and-twenty , and he has just been expressing a feeling which I share very heartily , and I would not willingly omit the opportunity of saying so . That feeling is his value and respect for Adam Bede . People in a high station are of course more thought of and talked about and have their virtues more praised , than those whose lives are passed in humble everyday work ; but every sensible man knows how necessary that humble everyday work is , and how important it is to us that it should be done well . And I agree with my friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne in feeling that when a man whose duty lies in that sort of work shows a character which would make him an example in any station , his merit should be acknowledged . He is one of those to whom honour is due , and his friends should delight to honour him . I know Adam Bede well -- I know what he is as a workman , and what he has been as a son and brother -- and I am saying the simplest truth when I say that I respect him as much as I respect any man living . But I am not speaking to you about a stranger ; some of you are his intimate friends , and I believe there is not one here who does not know enough of him to join heartily in drinking his health .

The commonest man , who has his ounce of sense and feeling , is conscious of the difference between a lovely , delicate woman and a coarse one . Even a dog feels a difference in their presence . The man may be no better able than the dog to explain the influence the more refined beauty has on him , but he feels it .

the reason . You want to learn accounts -- that 's well and good . But you think all you need do to learn accounts is to come to me and do sums for an hour or so , two or three times a-week ; and no sooner do you get your caps on and turn out of doors again than you sweep the whole thing clean out of your mind . You go whistling about , and take no more care what you 're thinking of than if your heads were gutters for any rubbish to swill through that happened to be in the way ; and if you get a good notion in 'em , it 's pretty soon washed out again . You think knowledge is to be got cheap -- you 'll come and pay Bartle Massey sixpence a-week , and he 'll make you clever at figures without your taking any trouble . But knowledge is n't to be got with paying sixpence , let me tell you . If you 're to know figures , you must turn 'em over in your heads and keep your thoughts fixed on 'em . There 's nothing you ca n't turn into a sum , for there 's nothing but what 's got number in it -- even a fool . You may say to yourselves , ` I 'm one fool , and Jack 's another ; if my fool 's head weighed four pound , and Jack 's three pound three ounces and three quarters , how many pennyweights heavier would my head be than Jack 's ? ' A man that had got his heart in learning figures would make sums for himself and work 'em in his head . When he sat at his shoemaking , he 'd count his stitches by fives , and then put a price on his stitches , say half a farthing , and then see how much money he could get in an hour ; and then ask himself how much money he 'd get in a day at that rate ; and then how much ten workmen would get working three , or twenty , or a hundred years at that rate -- and all the while his needle would be going just as fast as if he left his head empty for the devil to dance in . But the long and the short of it is -- I 'll have nobody in my night-school that does n't strive to learn what he comes to learn , as hard as if he was striving to get out of a dark hole into broad daylight . I 'll send no man away because he 's stupid : if Billy Taft , the idiot , wanted to learn anything , I 'd not refuse to teach him . But I 'll not throw away good knowledge on people who think they can get it by the sixpenn ` orth , and carry it away with 'em as they would an ounce of snuff . So never come to me again , if you ca n't show that you 've been working with your own heads , instead of thinking that you can pay for mine to work for you .

It 's the silliest lie a sensible man like you ever believed , to say a woman makes a house comfortable . It 's a story got up because the women are there and something must be found for 'em to do . I tell you there is n't a thing under the sun that needs to be done at all , but what a man can do better than a woman , unless it 's bearing children , and they do that in a poor make-shift way ; it had better ha ' been left to the men -- it had better ha ' been left to the men . I tell you , a woman ` ull bake you a pie every week of her life and never come to see that the hotter th ' oven the shorter the time . I tell you , a woman ` ull make your porridge every day for twenty years and never think of measuring the proportion between the meal and the milk -- a little more or less , she 'll think , does n't signify . The porridge WILL be awk ` ard now and then : if it 's wrong , it 's summat in the meal , or it 's summat in the milk , or it 's summat in the water . Look at me ! I make my own bread , and there 's no difference between one batch and another from year 's end to year 's end ; but if I 'd got any other woman besides Vixen in the house , I must pray to the Lord every baking to give me patience if the bread turned out heavy . And as for cleanliness , my house is cleaner than any other house on the Common , though the half of 'em swarm with women . Will Baker 's lad comes to help me in a morning , and we get as much cleaning done in one hour , without any fuss , as a woman ` ud get done in three , and all the while be sending buckets o ' water after your ankles , and let the fender and the fire-irons stand in the middle o ' the floor half the day for you to break your shins against 'em . Do n't tell me about God having made such creatures to be companions for us ! I do n't say but He might make Eve to be a companion to Adam in Paradise -- there was no cooking to be spoilt there , and no other woman to cackle with and make mischief , though you see what mischief she did as soon as she 'd an opportunity . But it 's an impious , unscriptural opinion to say a woman 's a blessing to a man now ; you might as well say adders and wasps , and foxes and wild beasts are a blessing , when they 're only the evils that belong to this state o ' probation , which it 's lawful for a man to keep as clear of as he can in this life , hoping to get quit of 'em for ever in another -- hoping to get quit of 'em for ever in another .

And then the little baby was born , when I did n't expect it ; and the thought came into my mind that I might get rid of it and go home again . The thought came all of a sudden , as I was lying in the bed , and it got stronger and stronger ... I longed so to go back again ... I could n't bear being so lonely and coming to beg for want . And it gave me strength and resolution to get up and dress myself . I felt I must do it ... I did n't know how ... I thought I 'd find a pool , if I could , like that other , in the corner of the field , in the dark . And when the woman went out , I felt as if I was strong enough to do anything ... I thought I should get rid of all my misery , and go back home , and never let 'em know why I ran away I put on my bonnet and shawl , and went out into the dark street , with the baby under my cloak ; and I walked fast till I got into a street a good way off , and there was a public , and I got some warm stuff to drink and some bread . And I walked on and on , and I hardly felt the ground I trod on ; and it got lighter , for there came the moon -- oh , Dinah , it frightened me when it first looked at me out o ' the clouds -- it never looked so before ; and I turned out of the road into the fields , for I was afraid o ' meeting anybody with the moon shining on me . And I came to a haystack , where I thought I could lie down and keep myself warm all night . There was a place cut into it , where I could make me a bed , and I lay comfortable , and the baby was warm against me ; and I must have gone to sleep for a good while , for when I woke it was morning , but not very light , and the baby was crying . And I saw a wood a little way off ... I thought there 'd perhaps be a ditch or a pond there ... and it was so early I thought I could hide the child there , and get a long way off before folks was up . And then I thought I 'd go home -- I 'd get rides in carts and go home and tell 'em I 'd been to try and see for a place , and could n't get one . I longed so for it , Dinah , I longed so to be safe at home . I do n't know how I felt about the baby . I seemed to hate it -- it was like a heavy weight hanging round my neck ; and yet its crying went through me , and I dared n't look at its little hands and face .

And I made haste out of the wood , but I could hear it crying all the while ; and when I got out into the fields , it was as if I was held fast -- I could n't go away , for all I wanted so to go . And I sat against the haystack to watch if anybody ` ud come . I was very hungry , and I 'd only a bit of bread left , but I could n't go away . And after ever such a while -- hours and hours -- the man came -- him in a smock-frock , and he looked at me so , I was frightened , and I made haste and went on . I thought he was going to the wood and would perhaps find the baby . And I went right on , till I came to a village , a long way off from the wood , and I was very sick , and faint , and hungry . I got something to eat there , and bought a loaf . But I was frightened to stay . I heard the baby crying , and thought the other folks heard it too -- and I went on . But I was so tired , and it was getting towards dark . And at last , by the roadside there was a barn -- ever such a way off any house -- like the barn in Abbot 's Close , and I thought I could go in there and hide myself among the hay and straw , and nobody ` ud be likely to come . I went in , and it was half full o ' trusses of straw , and there was some hay too . And I made myself a bed , ever so far behind , where nobody could find me ; and I was so tired and weak , I went to sleep ... But oh , the baby 's crying kept waking me , and I thought that man as looked at me so was come and laying hold of me . But I must have slept a long while at last , though I did n't know , for when I got up and went out of the barn , I did n't know whether it was night or morning .

It 's a deep mystery -- the way the heart of man turns to one woman out of all the rest he 's seen i ' the world , and makes it easier for him to work seven year for HER , like Jacob did for Rachel , sooner than have any other woman for th ' asking . I often think of them words , ` And Jacob served seven years for Rachel ; and they seemed to him but a few days for the love he had to her . ' I know those words ` ud come true with me , Dinah , if so be you 'd give me hope as I might win you after seven years was over . I know you think a husband ` ud be taking up too much o ' your thoughts , because St. Paul says , ` She that 's married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband ' ; and may happen you 'll think me overbold to speak to you about it again , after what you told me o ' your mind last Saturday . But I 've been thinking it over again by night and by day , and I 've prayed not to be blinded by my own desires , to think what 's only good for me must be good for you too . And it seems to me there 's more texts for your marrying than ever you can find against it . For St. Paul says as plain as can be in another place , ' I will that the younger women marry , bear children , guide the house , give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully ' ; and then ` two are better than one ' ; and that holds good with marriage as well as with other things . For we should be o ' one heart and o ' one mind , Dinah . We both serve the same Master , and are striving after the same gifts ; and I 'd never be the husband to make a claim on you as could interfere with your doing the work God has fitted you for .

'' ","i":14242},{"w":"`` Seth Bede , I thank you for your love towards me , and if I could think of any man as more than a Christian brother , I think it would be you . But my heart is not free to marry . That is good for other women , and it is a great and a blessed thing to be a wife and mother ; but ` as God has distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every man , so let him walk . ' God has called me to minister to others , not to have any joys or sorrows of my own , but to rejoice with them that do rejoice , and to weep with those that weep . He has called me to speak his word , and he has greatly owned my work . It could only be on a very clear showing that I could leave the brethren and sisters at Snowfield , who are favoured with very little of this world 's good ; where the trees are few , so that a child might count them , and there 's very hard living for the poor in the winter . It has been given me to help , to comfort , and strengthen the little flock there and to call in many wanderers ; and my soul is filled with these things from my rising up till my lying down . My life is too short , and God 's work is too great for me to think of making a home for myself in this world . I 've not turned a deaf ear to your words , Seth , for when I saw as your love was given to me , I thought it might be a leading of Providence for me to change my way of life , and that we should be fellow-helpers ; and I spread the matter before the Lord . But whenever I tried to fix my mind on marriage , and our living together , other thoughts always came in -- the times when I 've prayed by the sick and dying , and the happy hours I 've had preaching , when my heart was filled with love , and the Word was given to me abundantly . And when I 've opened the Bible for direction , I 've always lighted on some clear word to tell me where my work lay . I believe what you say , Seth , that you would try to be a help and not a hindrance to my work ; but I see that our marriage is not God 's will -- He draws my heart another way . I desire to live and die without husband or children . I seem to have no room in my soul for wants and fears of my own , it has pleased God to fill my heart so full with the wants and sufferings of his poor people . '' ","i":14824},{"w":"`` Well , Dinah , I must seek for strength to bear it , and to endure as seeing Him who is invisible . But I feel now how weak my faith is . It seems as if , when you are gone , I could never joy in anything any more .

I trusted as the strong love God has given me towards you was a leading for us both ; but it seems it was only meant for my trial . Perhaps I feel more for you than I ought to feel for any creature , for I often ca n't help saying of you what the hymn says -- In darkest shades if she appear , My dawning is begun ; She is my soul 's bright morning-star , And she my rising sun .

It 's like a bit o ' bad workmanship -- you never see th ' end o ' the mischief it 'll do . And it 's a poor look-out to come into the world to make your fellow-creatures worse off instead o ' better . But there 's a difference between the things folks call wrong . I 'm not for making a sin of every little fool 's trick , or bit o ' nonsense anybody may be let into , like some o ' them dissenters . And a man may have two minds whether it is n't worthwhile to get a bruise or two for the sake of a bit o ' fun . But it is n't my way to be see-saw about anything : I think my fault lies th ' other way . When I 've said a thing , if it 's only to myself , it 's hard for me to go back . '' ","i":79442},{"w":"`` But , '' ","i":85522},{"w":"`` I 've seen pretty clear , ever since I was a young un , as religion 's something else besides notions . It is n't notions sets people doing the right thing -- it 's feelings . It 's the same with the notions in religion as it is with math ` matics -- a man may be able to work problems straight off in 's head as he sits by the fire and smokes his pipe , but if he has to make a machine or a building , he must have a will and a resolution and love something else better than his own ease . Somehow , the congregation began to fall off , and people began to speak light o ' Mr. Ryde . I believe he meant right at bottom ; but , you see , he was sourish-tempered , and was for beating down prices with the people as worked for him ; and his preaching would n't go down well with that sauce . And he wanted to be like my lord judge i ' the parish , punishing folks for doing wrong ; and he scolded 'em from the pulpit as if he 'd been a Ranter , and yet he could n't abide the Dissenters , and was a deal more set against 'em than Mr. Irwine was . And then he did n't keep within his income , for he seemed to think at first go-off that six hundred a-year was to make him as big a man as Mr. Donnithorne . That 's a sore mischief I 've often seen with the poor curates jumping into a bit of a living all of a sudden . Mr. Ryde was a deal thought on at a distance , I believe , and he wrote books , but as for math ` matics and the natur o ' things , he was as ignorant as a woman . He was very knowing about doctrines , and used to call 'em the bulwarks of the Reformation ; but I 've always mistrusted that sort o ' learning as leaves folks foolish and unreasonable about business . Now Mester Irwine was as different as could be : as quick ! -- he understood what you meant in a minute , and he knew all about building , and could see when you 'd made a good job . And he behaved as much like a gentleman to the farmers , and th ' old women , and the labourers , as he did to the gentry . You never saw HIM interfering and scolding , and trying to play th ' emperor . Ah , he was a fine man as ever you set eyes on ; and so kind to 's mother and sisters . That poor sickly Miss Anne -- he seemed to think more of her than of anybody else in the world . There was n't a soul in the parish had a word to say against him ; and his servants stayed with him till they were so old and pottering , he had to hire other folks to do their work . '' ","i":85529},{"w":"`` Nay , nay , '' ","i":86129},{"w":"`` nobody has ever heard me say Mr. Irwine was much of a preacher . He did n't go into deep speritial experience ; and I know there s a deal in a man 's inward life as you ca n't measure by the square , and say , ` Do this and that 'll follow , ' and , ` Do that and this 'll follow . ' There 's things go on in the soul , and times when feelings come into you like a rushing mighty wind , as the Scripture says , and part your life in two a ` most , so you look back on yourself as if you was somebody else . Those are things as you ca n't bottle up in a ` do this ' and ` do that ' ; and I 'll go so far with the strongest Methodist ever you 'll find . That shows me there 's deep speritial things in religion . You ca n't make much out wi ' talking about it , but you feel it . Mr. Irwine did n't go into those things -- he preached short moral sermons , and that was all . But then he acted pretty much up to what he said ; he did n't set up for being so different from other folks one day , and then be as like 'em as two peas the next . And he made folks love him and respect him , and that was better nor stirring up their gall wi ' being overbusy . Mrs. Poyser used to say -- you know she would have her word about everything -- she said , Mr. Irwine was like a good meal o ' victual , you were the better for him without thinking on it , and Mr. Ryde was like a dose o ' physic , he gripped you and worreted you , and after all he left you much the same . '' ","i":86159},{"w":"`` Eh , I knowna . He preached a deal about doctrines . But I 've seen pretty clear , ever since I was a young un , as religion 's something else besides doctrines and notions . I look at it as if the doctrines was like finding names for your feelings , so as you can talk of 'em when you 've never known 'em , just as a man may talk o ' tools when he knows their names , though he 's never so much as seen 'em , still less handled 'em . I 've heard a deal o ' doctrine i ' my time , for I used to go after the Dissenting preachers along wi ' Seth , when I was a lad o ' seventeen , and got puzzling myself a deal about th ' Arminians and the Calvinists . The Wesleyans , you know , are strong Arminians ; and Seth , who could never abide anything harsh and was always for hoping the best , held fast by the Wesleyans from the very first ; but I thought I could pick a hole or two in their notions , and I got disputing wi ' one o ' the class leaders down at Treddles ` on , and harassed him so , first o ' this side and then o ' that , till at last he said , ` Young man , it 's the devil making use o ' your pride and conceit as a weapon to war against the simplicity o ' the truth . ' I could n't help laughing then , but as I was going home , I thought the man was n't far wrong . I began to see as all this weighing and sifting what this text means and that text means , and whether folks are saved all by God 's grace , or whether there goes an ounce o ' their own will to ` t , was no part o ' real religion at all . You may talk o ' these things for hours on end , and you 'll only be all the more coxy and conceited for ` t . So I took to going nowhere but to church , and hearing nobody but Mr. Irwine , for he said nothing but what was good and what you 'd be the wiser for remembering . And I found it better for my soul to be humble before the mysteries o ' God 's dealings , and not be making a clatter about what I could never understand . And they 're poor foolish questions after all ; for what have we got either inside or outside of us but what comes from God ? If we 've got a resolution to do right , He gave it us , I reckon , first or last ; but I see plain enough we shall never do it without a resolution , and that 's enough for me . '' ","i":86536},{"w":"`` Ah ! I was always too hard , '' ","i":95777},{"w":"`` It 's a sore fault in me as I 'm so hot and out o ' patience with people when they do wrong , and my heart gets shut up against 'em , so as I ca n't bring myself to forgive 'em . I see clear enough there 's more pride nor love in my soul , for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th ' hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him . And there went plenty o ' pride and temper to the strokes , as the devil WILL be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins . Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself . It 's allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still , but the real tough job for me ` ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against my own pride . It seems to me now , if I was to find Father at home to-night , I should behave different ; but there 's no knowing -- perhaps nothing ` ud be a lesson to us if it did n't come too late . It 's well we should feel as life 's a reckoning we ca n't make twice over ; there 's no real making amends in this world , any more nor you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right .

And I gave her the letter , and she seemed to bear it all after a while better than I 'd expected ... and she behaved kinder and kinder to me ...

I know , I feel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of Arthur 's has caused to others ; but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides those who commit it . An act of vengeance on your part against Arthur would simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under : you could not bear the punishment alone ; you would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you . You would have committed an act of blind fury that would leave all the present evils just as they were and add worse evils to them . You may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of vengeance , but the feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such actions , and as long as you indulge it , as long as you do not see that to fix your mind on Arthur 's punishment is revenge , and not justice , you are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great wrong .

I told the mother in the day-time she must tell me the name of her friends , and where they lived , and let me write to them . She said , by and by she would write herself , but not to-day . She would have no nay , but she would get up and be dressed , in spite of everything I could say . She said she felt quite strong enough ; and it was wonderful what spirit she showed . But I was n't quite easy what I should do about her , and towards evening I made up my mind I 'd go , after Meeting was over , and speak to our minister about it . I left the house about half-past eight o'clock . I did n't go out at the shop door , but at the back door , which opens into a narrow alley . I 've only got the ground-floor of the house , and the kitchen and bedroom both look into the alley . I left the prisoner sitting up by the fire in the kitchen with the baby on her lap . She had n't cried or seemed low at all , as she did the night before . I thought she had a strange look with her eyes , and she got a bit flushed towards evening . I was afraid of the fever , and I thought I 'd call and ask an acquaintance of mine , an experienced woman , to come back with me when I went out . It was a very dark night . I did n't fasten the door behind me ; there was no lock ; it was a latch with a bolt inside , and when there was nobody in the house I always went out at the shop door . But I thought there was no danger in leaving it unfastened that little while . I was longer than I meant to be , for I had to wait for the woman that came back with me . It was an hour and a half before we got back , and when we went in , the candle was standing burning just as I left it , but the prisoner and the baby were both gone . She 'd taken her cloak and bonnet , but she 'd left the basket and the things in it ... I was dreadful frightened , and angry with her for going . I did n't go to give information , because I 'd no thought she meant to do any harm , and I knew she had money in her pocket to buy her food and lodging .

It had got comfortable clothes on , but its body was cold , and I thought it must be dead . I made haste back with it out of the wood , and took it home to my wife . She said it was dead , and I 'd better take it to the parish and tell the constable . And I said , ` I 'll lay my life it 's that young woman 's child as I met going to the coppice . ' But she seemed to be gone clean out of sight . And I took the child on to Hetton parish and told the constable , and we went on to Justice Hardy . And then we went looking after the young woman till dark at night , and we went and gave information at Stoniton , as they might stop her . And the next morning , another constable came to me , to go with him to the spot where I found the child .

It 's better than twelve miles from Snowfield , so we set out early in the morning , for it was summertime ; and I had a wonderful sense of the Divine love as we walked over the hills , where there 's no trees , you know , sir , as there is here , to make the sky look smaller , but you see the heavens stretched out like a tent , and you feel the everlasting arms around you . But before we got to Hetton , brother Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him afraid of falling , for he overworked himself sadly , at his years , in watching and praying , and walking so many miles to speak the Word , as well as carrying on his trade of linen-weaving . And when we got to the village , the people were expecting him , for he 'd appointed the time and the place when he was there before , and such of them as cared to hear the Word of Life were assembled on a spot where the cottages was thickest , so as others might be drawn to come . But he felt as he could n't stand up to preach , and he was forced to lie down in the first of the cottages we came to . So I went to tell the people , thinking we 'd go into one of the houses , and I would read and pray with them . But as I passed along by the cottages and saw the aged and trembling women at the doors , and the hard looks of the men , who seemed to have their eyes no more filled with the sight of the Sabbath morning than if they had been dumb oxen that never looked up to the sky , I felt a great movement in my soul , and I trembled as if I was shaken by a strong spirit entering into my weak body . And I went to where the little flock of people was gathered together , and stepped on the low wall that was built against the green hillside , and I spoke the words that were given to me abundantly . And they all came round me out of all the cottages , and many wept over their sins , and have since been joined to the Lord . That was the beginning of my preaching , sir , and I 've preached ever since . '' ","i":42418},{"w":"`` Ah , their poor aged mother !
