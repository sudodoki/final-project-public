If you had married this girl , you would have been wretched . Of course , you would have treated her kindly . One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing . But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her . And when a woman finds that out about her husband , she either becomes dreadfully dowdy , or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman 's husband has to pay for . I say nothing about the social mistake , which would have been abject -- which , of course , I would not have allowed -- but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure .

I am nothing of the kind . I know I am not . And yet I must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should .

I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to Selby , and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way . You never got it back ? What a pity ! it was really a masterpiece . I remember I wanted to buy it . I wish I had now . It belonged to Basil 's best period .

A wet Sunday , an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh , a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas , and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips -- it was really very good in its way , quite a suggestion .

Now , wherever you go , you charm the world . Will it always be so ? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face , Mr. Gray . Do n't frown . You have . And beauty is a form of genius -- is higher , indeed , than genius , as it needs no explanation . It is of the great facts of the world , like sunlight , or spring-time , or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon . It can not be questioned . It has its divine right of sovereignty . It makes princes of those who have it . You smile ? Ah ! when you have lost it you wo n't smile ... . People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial . That may be so , but at least it is not so superficial as thought is . To me , beauty is the wonder of wonders . It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances . The true mystery of the world is the visible , not the invisible ... . Yes , Mr. Gray , the gods have been good to you . But what the gods give they quickly take away . You have only a few years in which to live really , perfectly , and fully . When your youth goes , your beauty will go with it , and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you , or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats . Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful . Time is jealous of you , and wars against your lilies and your roses . You will become sallow , and hollow-cheeked , and dull-eyed . You will suffer horribly ... . Ah ! realize your youth while you have it . Do n't squander the gold of your days , listening to the tedious , trying to improve the hopeless failure , or giving away your life to the ignorant , the common , and the vulgar . These are the sickly aims , the false ideals , of our age . Live ! Live the wonderful life that is in you ! Let nothing be lost upon you . Be always searching for new sensations . Be afraid of nothing ... . A new Hedonism -- that is what our century wants . You might be its visible symbol . With your personality there is nothing you could not do . The world belongs to you for a season ... . The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are , of what you really might be . There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself . I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted . For there is such a little time that your youth will last -- such a little time . The common hill-flowers wither , but they blossom again . The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now . In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis , and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars . But we never get back our youth .

Here , one should never make one 's _ debut _ with a scandal . One should reserve that to give an interest to one 's old age . I suppose they do n't know your name at the theatre ? If they do n't , it is all right . Did any one see you going round to her room ? That is an important point . '' ","i":41911},{"w":"`` Harry , did you say an inquest ? What did you mean by that ?

Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that . The birds sing just as happily in my garden . And to-night I am to dine with you , and then go on to the opera , and sup somewhere , I suppose , afterwards . How extraordinarily dramatic life is ! If I had read all this in a book , Harry , I think I would have wept over it . Somehow , now that it has happened actually , and to me , it seems far too wonderful for tears . Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my life . Strange , that my first passionate love-letter should have been addressed to a dead girl . Can they feel , I wonder , those white silent people we call the dead ? Sibyl ! Can she feel , or know , or listen ? Oh , Harry , how I loved her once ! It seems years ago to me now . She was everything to me . Then came that dreadful night -- was it really only last night ? -- when she played so badly , and my heart almost broke . She explained it all to me . It was terribly pathetic . But I was not moved a bit . I thought her shallow . Suddenly something happened that made me afraid . I ca n't tell you what it was , but it was terrible . I said I would go back to her . I felt I had done wrong . And now she is dead . My God ! My God ! Harry , what shall I do ? You do n't know the danger I am in , and there is nothing to keep me straight . She would have done that for me . She had no right to kill herself . It was selfish of her . '' ","i":42395},{"w":"`` Harry , '' ","i":43066},{"w":"`` why is it that I can not feel this tragedy as much as I want to ? I do n't think I am heartless . Do you ? '' ","i":43082},{"w":"`` I must sow poppies in my garden , '' ","i":43594},{"w":"`` You have explained me to myself , Harry , '' ","i":44637},{"w":"`` I do n't feel up to it , '' ","i":44944},{"w":"`` Good-bye . I shall see you before nine-thirty , I hope . Remember , Patti is singing . '' ","i":45017},{"w":"`` My dear Basil , how do I know ? '' ","i":46305},{"w":"`` Stop , Basil ! I wo n't hear it ! '' ","i":46566},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":47037},{"w":"`` there is nothing fearful about it . It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age . As a rule , people who act lead the most commonplace lives . They are good husbands , or faithful wives , or something tedious . You know what I mean -- middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing . How different Sibyl was ! She lived her finest tragedy . She was always a heroine . The last night she played -- the night you saw her -- she acted badly because she had known the reality of love . When she knew its unreality , she died , as Juliet might have died . She passed again into the sphere of art . There is something of the martyr about her . Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom , all its wasted beauty . But , as I was saying , you must not think I have not suffered . If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment -- about half-past five , perhaps , or a quarter to six -- you would have found me in tears . Even Harry , who was here , who brought me the news , in fact , had no idea what I was going through . I suffered immensely . Then it passed away . I can not repeat an emotion . No one can , except sentimentalists . And you are awfully unjust , Basil . You come down here to console me . That is charming of you . You find me consoled , and you are furious . How like a sympathetic person ! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed , or some unjust law altered -- I forget exactly what it was . Finally he succeeded , and nothing could exceed his disappointment . He had absolutely nothing to do , almost died of _ ennui _ , and became a confirmed misanthrope . And besides , my dear old Basil , if you really want to console me , teach me rather to forget what has happened , or to see it from a proper artistic point of view . Was it not Gautier who used to write about _ la consolation des arts _ ? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase . Well , I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together , the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life . I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle . Old brocades , green bronzes , lacquer-work , carved ivories , exquisite surroundings , luxury , pomp -- there is much to be got from all these . But the artistic temperament that they create , or at any rate reveal , is still more to me . To become the spectator of one 's own life , as Harry says , is to escape the suffering of life . I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this . You have not realized how I have developed . I was a schoolboy when you knew me . I am a man now . I have new passions , new thoughts , new ideas . I am different , but you must not like me less . I am changed , but you must always be my friend . Of course , I am very fond of Harry . But I know that you are better than he is . You are not stronger -- you are too much afraid of life -- but you are better . And how happy we used to be together ! Do n't leave me , Basil , and do n't quarrel with me . I am what I am . There is nothing more to be said . '' ","i":47045},{"w":"`` inquest . '' ","i":47897},{"w":"`` They do n't know my name , '' ","i":47914},{"w":"`` I can never sit to you again , Basil . It is impossible ! '' ","i":48056},{"w":"`` Basil , '' ","i":48286},{"w":"`` you must not look at it . I do n't wish you to . '' ","i":48297},{"w":"`` To exhibit it ! You want to exhibit it ? '' ","i":48572},{"w":"`` Yes ; I do n't suppose you will object to that . Georges Petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de Seze , which will open the first week in October . The portrait will only be away a month . I should think you could easily spare it for that time . In fact , you are sure to be out of town . And if you keep it always behind a screen , you ca n't care much about it . '' ","i":48637},{"w":"`` You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it , '' ","i":48760},{"w":"`` Why have you changed your mind ? You people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have . The only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless . You ca n't have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition . You told Harry exactly the same thing . '' ","i":48778},{"w":"`` No , Basil , you must tell me , '' ","i":49097},{"w":"`` I see you did . Do n't speak . Wait till you hear what I have to say . Dorian , from the moment I met you , your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me . I was dominated , soul , brain , and power , by you . You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream . I worshipped you . I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke . I wanted to have you all to myself . I was only happy when I was with you . When you were away from me , you were still present in my art ... . Of course , I never let you know anything about this . It would have been impossible . You would not have understood it . I hardly understood it myself . I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face , and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes -- too wonderful , perhaps , for in such mad worships there is peril , the peril of losing them , no less than the peril of keeping them ... . Weeks and weeks went on , and I grew more and more absorbed in you . Then came a new development . I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour , and as Adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar-spear . Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid Nile . You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . And it had all been what art should be -- unconscious , ideal , and remote . One day , a fatal day I sometimes think , I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . Whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , I can not tell . But I know that as I worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret . I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry . I felt , Dorian , that I had told too much , that I had put too much of myself into it . Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited . You were a little annoyed ; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me . Harry , to whom I talked about it , laughed at me . But I did not mind that . When the picture was finished , and I sat alone with it , I felt that I was right ... . Well , after a few days the thing left my studio , and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence , it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it , more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint . Even now I can not help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates . Art is always more abstract than we fancy . Form and colour tell us of form and colour -- that is all . It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him . And so when I got this offer from Paris , I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition . It never occurred to me that you would refuse . I see now that you were right . The picture can not be shown . You must not be angry with me , Dorian , for what I have told you . As I said to Harry , once , you are made to be worshipped . '' ","i":49233},{"w":"`` Well , you do n't mind my looking at the thing now ? '' ","i":50152},{"w":"`` My dear Basil , '' ","i":50273},{"w":"`` what have you told me ? Simply that you felt that you admired me too much . That is not even a compliment . '' ","i":50282},{"w":"`` What can I do for you , Mr. Gray ? '' ","i":52046},{"w":"`` This , '' ","i":52233},{"w":"`` I will show you the way , Mr. Hubbard , if you will kindly follow me . Or perhaps you had better go in front . I am afraid it is right at the top of the house . We will go up by the front staircase , as it is wider . '' ","i":52327},{"w":"`` I am afraid it is rather heavy , '' ","i":52487},{"w":"`` Might one look at the work of art , sir ? '' ","i":53224},{"w":"`` It would not interest you , Mr. Hubbard , '' ","i":53240},{"w":"`` I shall be charmed . But wo n't you miss your train ? '' ","i":63403},{"w":"`` The train does n't go till twelve-fifteen , and it is only just eleven . In fact , I was on my way to the club to look for you , when I met you . You see , I sha n't have any delay about luggage , as I have sent on my heavy things . All I have with me is in this bag , and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes . '' ","i":63462},{"w":"`` You see your servant made me quite at home , Dorian . He gave me everything I wanted , including your best gold-tipped cigarettes . He is a most hospitable creature . I like him much better than the Frenchman you used to have . What has become of the Frenchman , by the bye ? '' ","i":63659},{"w":"`` What is it all about ? '' ","i":63915},{"w":"`` Half an hour !

If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end , I shall believe you . Deny them , Dorian , deny them ! Ca n't you see what I am going through ?
