Consider also that I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking , for which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise ; and now , at the moment when I reckoned upon success , my hopes are forever dashed from me .

Never , till then , had I placed any confidence in presentiments , but now I can not help believing them , Valentine . At the sound of that carriage I shuddered ; soon I heard steps on the staircase , which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan . The door at last opened ; Albert de Morcerf entered first , and I began to hope my fears were vain , when , after him , another young man advanced , and the count exclaimed -- ` Ah , here is the Baron Franz d'Epinay !

One day you acknowledged that you loved me , and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you , for to gain you would be life to me .

With opium , belladonna , brucaea , snake-wood , and the cherry-laurel , they put to sleep all who stand in their way .

Instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic , he had watered it this time with a solution of salts , having their basis in strychnine , strychnos colubrina , as the learned term it . Now , the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world , and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust ; yet , five minutes afterwards , the rabbit was dead . The fowl pecked at the rabbit , and the next day was a dead hen . This time we were the vultures ; so we opened the bird , and this time all special symptoms had disappeared , there were only general symptoms . There was no peculiar indication in any organ -- an excitement of the nervous system -- that was it ; a case of cerebral congestion -- nothing more . The fowl had not been poisoned -- she had died of apoplexy . Apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls , I believe , but very common among men .

After every action requiring exertion , it is conscience that saves us , for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses , of which we alone are judges ; and these reasons , howsoever excellent in producing sleep , would avail us but very little before a tribunal , when we were tried for our lives . Thus Richard III. , for instance , was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of Edward IV. ; in fact , he could say , ` These two children of a cruel and persecuting king , who have inherited the vices of their father , which I alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities -- these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the English people , whose unhappiness they -LRB- the children -RRB- would infallibly have caused . ' Thus was Lady Macbeth served by her conscience , when she sought to give her son , and not her husband -LRB- whatever Shakespeare may say -RRB- , a throne .

From that time I looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for an especial purpose . Not a thought was given to a life which you once , Mercedes , had the power to render blissful ; not one hour of peaceful calm was mine ; but I felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel . Like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger , I laid in my provisions , I loaded my weapons , I collected every means of attack and defence ; I inured my body to the most violent exercises , my soul to the bitterest trials ; I taught my arm to slay , my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings , and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles . Good-natured , confiding , and forgiving as I had been , I became revengeful , cunning , and wicked , or rather , immovable as fate . Then I launched out into the path that was opened to me . I overcame every obstacle , and reached the goal ; but woe to those who stood in my pathway ! '' ","i":554830},{"w":"`` Ah , madame , '' ","i":555960},{"w":"`` you should not talk thus !

It was evident that the abbe limited himself to objects of strict necessity . He preferred to use the sitting-room upstairs , which was more library than parlor , and was furnished with theological books and parchments , in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time , according to his valet de chambre .

Besides , whether at home or not , whether in Paris or Cairo , the abbe always left something to give away , which the valet distributed through this wicket in his master 's name . The other room near the library was a bedroom . A bed without curtains , four arm-chairs , and a couch , covered with yellow Utrecht velvet , composed , with a prie-Dieu , all its furniture . Lord Wilmore resided in Rue Fontaine-Saint-George . He was one of those English tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling .

For all evils there are two remedies -- time and silence . And now leave me , Monsieur Bertuccio , to walk alone here in the garden . The very circumstances which inflict on you , as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here , such painful emotions , are to me , on the contrary , a source of something like contentment , and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation . The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs , while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade . Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination , and furnished with thickly grown trees , beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will . This to me , who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall , is , I assure you , a most agreeable surprise . I have no fear of ghosts , and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day . Retire within , Bertuccio , and tranquillize your mind . Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the Abbe Busoni , send for me , if I am still on earth , and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity .

At the end of two hundred years the documents were found , and they thought of bringing up the jars . Divers descended in machines , made expressly on the discovery , into the bay where they were thrown ; but of ten three only remained , the rest having been broken by the waves .

This costume is a fancy one , it appears , and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830 . The countess had this portrait painted during the count 's absence . She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise ; but , strange to say , this portrait seemed to displease my father , and the value of the picture , which is , as you see , one of the best works of Leopold Robert , could not overcome his dislike to it . It is true , between ourselves , that M. de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg , a general renowned for theory , but a most mediocre amateur of art . It is different with my mother , who paints exceedingly well , and who , unwilling to part with so valuable a picture , gave it to me to put here , where it would be less likely to displease M. de Morcerf , whose portrait , by Gros , I will also show you . Excuse my talking of family matters , but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count , I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture . The picture seems to have a malign influence , for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it , and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping .

You are somewhat blase I know , and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor , who has seen so many others .

I tendered my resignation , for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle-field , you do not know how to manoeuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons .

On descending , we saw through the lattice-work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view .

They were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother-of-pearl and silver , and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor . My father looked at his watch , and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish . This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last kiss . My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern . Selim was still at his post , and smiled sadly on us as we entered . We fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern , and sat down by Selim .

He held some papers in his hand ; his countenance was calm , and his step firm , and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform , which was buttoned completely up to the chin .

He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence , since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor . He produced the ring , his mark of authority , with which Ali Pasha generally sealed his letters , and which the latter had given him , that he might , on his return at any hour of the day or night , gain access to the presence , even in the harem . Unfortunately , the negotiation failed , and when he returned to defend his benefactor , he was dead . ` But , ' said the count , ` so great was Ali Pasha 's confidence , that on his death-bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care .
