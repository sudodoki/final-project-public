SCENE . -- Messina . ACT I. Scene I . An orchard before Leonato 's house . Enter Leonato -LRB- Governor of Messina -RRB- , Hero -LRB- his Daughter -RRB- , and Beatrice -LRB- his Niece -RRB- , with a Messenger . Leon . I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina . Mess . He is very near by this . He was not three leagues off when I left him . Leon . How many gentlemen have you lost in this action ? Mess . But few of any sort , and none of name . Leon . A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers . I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio . Mess . Much deserv 'd on his part , and equally rememb ` red by Don Pedro . He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age , doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion . He hath indeed better bett ` red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how . Leon . He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it . Mess . I have already delivered him letters , and there appears much joy in him ; even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness . Leon . Did he break out into tears ? Mess . In great measure . Leon . A kind overflow of kindness . There are no faces truer than those that are so wash 'd . How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping ! Beat . I pray you , is Signior Mountanto return 'd from the wars or no ? Mess . I know none of that name , lady . There was none such in the army of any sort . Leon . What is he that you ask for , niece ? Hero . My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua . Mess . O , he 's return 'd , and as pleasant as ever he was . Beat . He set up his bills here in Messina and challeng 'd Cupid at the flight , and my uncle 's fool , reading the challenge , subscrib 'd for Cupid and challeng 'd him at the burbolt . I pray you , how many hath he kill 'd and eaten in these wars ? But how many hath he kill 'd ? For indeed I promised to eat all of his killing . Leon . Faith , niece , you tax Signior Benedick too much ; but he 'll be meet with you , I doubt it not . Mess . He hath done good service , lady , in these wars . Beat . You had musty victual , and he hath holp to eat it . He is a very valiant trencherman ; he hath an excellent stomach . Mess . And a good soldier too , lady . Beat . And a good soldier to a lady ; but what is he to a lord ? Mess . A lord to a lord , a man to a man ; stuff 'd with all honourable virtues . Beat . It is so indeed . He is no less than a stuff 'd man ; but for the stuffing -- well , we are all mortal . Leon . You must not , sir , mistake my niece . There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her . They never meet but there 's a skirmish of wit between them . Beat . Alas , he gets nothing by that ! In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off , and now is the whole man govern 'd with one ; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm , let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse ; for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature . Who is his companion now ? He hath every month a new sworn brother . Mess . Is ' t possible ? Beat . Very easily possible . He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat ; it ever changes with the next block . Mess . I see , lady , the gentleman is not in your books . Beat . No . An he were , I would burn my study . But I pray you , who is his companion ? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil ? Mess . He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio . Beat . O Lord , he will hang upon him like a disease ! He is sooner caught than the pestilence , and the taker runs presently mad . God help the noble Claudio ! If he have caught the Benedick , it will cost him a thousand pound ere ' a be cured . Mess . I will hold friends with you , lady . Beat . Do , good friend . Leon . You will never run mad , niece . Beat . No , not till a hot January . Mess . Don Pedro is approach 'd . Enter Don Pedro , Claudio , Benedick , Balthasar , and John the Bastard . Pedro . Good Signior Leonato , are you come to meet your trouble ? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost , and you encounter it . Leon . Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace ; for trouble being gone , comfort should remain ; but when you depart from me , sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave . Pedro . You embrace your charge too willingly . I think this is your daughter . Leon . Her mother hath many times told me so . Bene . Were you in doubt , sir , that you ask 'd her ? Leon . Signior Benedick , no ; for then were you a child . Pedro . You have it full , Benedick . We may guess by this what you are , being a man . Truly the lady fathers herself . Be happy , lady ; for you are like an honourable father . Bene . If Signior Leonato be her father , she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina , as like him as she is . Beat . I wonder that you will still be talking , Signior Benedick . Nobody marks you . Bene . What , my dear Lady Disdain ! are you yet living ? Beat . Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick ? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence . Bene . Then is courtesy a turncoat . But it is certain I am loved of all ladies , only you excepted ; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart , for truly I love none . Beat . A dear happiness to women ! They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor . I thank God and my cold blood , I am of your humour for that . I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me . Bene . God keep your ladyship still in that mind ! So some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratch 'd face . Beat . Scratching could not make it worse an ` twere such a face as yours were . Bene . Well , you are a rare parrot-teacher . Beat . A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours . Bene . I would my horse had the speed of your tongue , and so good a continuer . But keep your way , a God 's name ! I have done . Beat . You always end with a jade 's trick . I know you of old . Pedro . That is the sum of all , Leonato . Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick , my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all . I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month , and he heartly prays some occasion may detain us longer . I dare swear he is no hypocrite , but prays from his heart . Leon . If you swear , my lord , you shall not be forsworn . -LSB- To Don John -RSB- Let me bid you welcome , my lord . Being reconciled to the Prince your brother , I owe you all duty . John . I thank you . I am not of many words , but I thank you . Leon . Please it your Grace lead on ? Pedro . Your hand , Leonato . We will go together . Exeunt . Manent Benedick and Claudio . Claud . Benedick , didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato ? Bene . I noted her not , but I look 'd on her . Claud . Is she not a modest young lady ? Bene . Do you question me , as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment ? or would you have me speak after my custom , as being a professed tyrant to their sex ? Claud . No . I pray thee speak in sober judgment . Bene . Why , i ' faith , methinks she 's too low for a high praise , too brown for a fair praise , and too little for a great praise . Only this commendation I can afford her , that were she other than she is , she were unhandsome , and being no other but as she is , I do not like her . Claud . Thou thinkest I am in sport . I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik ` st her . Bene . Would you buy her , that you enquire after her ? Claud . Can the world buy such a jewel ? Bene . Yea , and a case to put it into . But speak you this with a sad brow ? or do you play the flouting Jack , to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter ? Come , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song ? Claud . In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I look 'd on . Bene . I can see yet without spectacles , and I see no such matter . There 's her cousin , an she were not possess 'd with a fury , exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December . But I hope you have no intent to turn husband , have you ? Claud . I would scarce trust myself , though I had sworn the contrary , if Hero would be my wife . Bene . Is ' t come to this ? In faith , hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion ? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again ? Go to , i ' faith ! An thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke , wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays . Enter Don Pedro . Look ! Don Pedro is returned to seek you . Pedro . What secret hath held you here , that you followed not to Leonato 's ? Bene . I would your Grace would constrain me to tell . Pedro . I charge thee on thy allegiance . Bene . You hear , Count Claudio . I can be secret as a dumb man , I would have you think so ; but , on my allegiance -- mark you this-on my allegiance ! he is in love . With who ? Now that is your Grace 's part . Mark how short his answer is : With Hero , Leonato 's short daughter . Claud . If this were so , so were it utt ` red . Bene . Like the old tale , my lord : ` It is not so , nor 't was not so ; but indeed , God forbid it should be so ! ' Claud . If my passion change not shortly , God forbid it should be otherwise . Pedro . Amen , if you love her ; for the lady is very well worthy . Claud . You speak this to fetch me in , my lord . Pedro . By my troth , I speak my thought . Claud . And , in faith , my lord , I spoke mine . Bene . And , by my two faiths and troths , my lord , I spoke mine . Claud . That I love her , I feel . Pedro . That she is worthy , I know . Bene . That I neither feel how she should be loved , nor know how she should be worthy , is the opinion that fire can not melt out of me . I will die in it at the stake . Pedro . Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty . Claud . And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will . Bene . That a woman conceived me , I thank her ; that she brought me up , I likewise give her most humble thanks ; but that I will have a rechate winded in my forehead , or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick , all women shall pardon me . Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any , I will do myself the right to trust none ; and the fine is -LRB- for the which I may go the finer -RRB- , I will live a bachelor . Pedro . I shall see thee , ere I die , look pale with love . Bene . With anger , with sickness , or with hunger , my lord ; not with love . Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking , pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker 's pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid . Pedro . Well , if ever thou dost fall from this faith , thou wilt prove a notable argument . Bene . If I do , hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me ; and he that hits me , let him be clapp 'd on the shoulder and call 'd Adam . Pedro . Well , as time shall try . ` In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke . ' Bene . The savage bull may ; but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it , pluck off the bull 's horns and set them in my forehead , and let me be vilely painted , and in such great letters as they write ` Here is good horse to hire , ' let them signify under my sign ` Here you may see Benedick the married man . ' Claud . If this should ever happen , thou wouldst be horn-mad . Pedro . Nay , if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice , thou wilt quake for this shortly . Bene . I look for an earthquake too then . Pedro . Well , you will temporize with the hours . In the meantime , good Signior Benedick , repair to Leonato 's , commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper ; for indeed he hath made great preparation . Bene . I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage ; and so I commit you -- Claud . To the tuition of God . From my house -- if I had it -- Pedro . The sixth of July . Your loving friend , Benedick . Bene . Nay , mock not , mock not . The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments , and the guards are but slightly basted on neither . Ere you flout old ends any further , examine your conscience . And so I leave you . Exit . Claud . My liege , your Highness now may do me good . Pedro . My love is thine to teach . Teach it but how , And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good . Claud . Hath Leonato any son , my lord ? Pedro . No child but Hero ; she 's his only heir . Dost thou affect her , Claudio ? Claud.O my lord , When you went onward on this ended action , I look 'd upon her with a soldier 's eye , That lik 'd , but had a rougher task in hand Than to drive liking to the name of love ; But now I am return 'd and that war-thoughts Have left their places vacant , in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires , All prompting me how fair young Hero is , Saying I lik 'd her ere I went to wars . Pedro . Thou wilt be like a lover presently And tire the hearer with a book of words . If thou dost love fair Hero , cherish it , And I will break with her and with her father , And thou shalt have her . Wast not to this end That thou began ` st to twist so fine a story ? Claud . How sweetly you do minister to love , That know love 's grief by his complexion ! But lest my liking might too sudden seem , I would have salv 'd it with a longer treatise . Pedro . What need the bridge much broader than the flood ? The fairest grant is the necessity . Look , what will serve is fit . 'T is once , thou lovest , And I will fit thee with the remedy . I know we shall have revelling to-night . I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio , And in her bosom I 'll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale . Then after to her father will I break , And the conclusion is , she shall be thine . In practice let us put it presently . Exeunt . Scene II . A room in Leonato 's house . Enter -LSB- at one door -RSB- Leonato and -LSB- at another door , Antonio -RSB- an old man , brother to Leonato . Leon . How now , brother ? Where is my cousin your son ? Hath he provided this music ? Ant . He is very busy about it . But , brother , I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of . Leon . Are they good ? Ant . As the event stamps them ; but they have a good cover , they show well outward . The Prince and Count Claudio , walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard , were thus much overheard by a man of mine : the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance , and if he found her accordant , he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it . Leon . Hath the fellow any wit that told you this ? Ant . A good sharp fellow . I will send for him , and question him yourself . Leon . No , no . We will hold it as a dream till it appear itself ; but I will acquaint my daughter withal , that she may be the better prepared for an answer , if peradventure this be true . Go you and tell her of it . -LSB- Exit Antonio . -RSB- -LSB- Enter Antonio 's Son with a Musician , and others . -RSB- -LSB- To the Son -RSB- Cousin , you know what you have to do . -- -LSB- To the Musician -RSB- O , I cry you mercy , friend . Go you with me , and I will use your skill . -- Good cousin , have a care this busy time . Exeunt . Scene III . Another room in Leonato 's house . -RSB- Enter Sir John the Bastard and Conrade , his companion . Con . What the goodyear , my lord ! Why are you thus out of measure sad ? John . There is no measure in the occasion that breeds ; therefore the sadness is without limit . Con . You should hear reason . John . And when I have heard it , what blessings brings it ? Con . If not a present remedy , at least a patient sufferance . John . I wonder that thou -LRB- being , as thou say ` st thou art , born under Saturn -RRB- goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief . I can not hide what I am : I must be sad when I have cause , and smile at no man 's jests ; eat when I have stomach , and wait for no man 's leisure ; sleep when I am drowsy , and tend on no man 's business ; laugh when I am merry , and claw no man in his humour . Con . Yea , but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment . You have of late stood out against your brother , and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace , where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself . It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest . John . I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace , and it better fits my blood to be disdain 'd of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any . In this , though I can not be said to be a flattering honest man , it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain . I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchis 'd with a clog ; therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage . If I had my mouth , I would bite ; if I had my liberty , I would do my liking . In the meantime let me be that I am , and seek not to alter me . Con . Can you make no use of your discontent ? John . I make all use of it , for I use it only . Enter Borachio . Who comes here ? What news , Borachio ? Bora . I came yonder from a great supper . The Prince your brother is royally entertain 'd by Leonato , and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage . John . Will it serve for any model to build mischief on ? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness ? Bora . Marry , it is your brother 's right hand . John . Who ? the most exquisite Claudio ? Bora . Even he . John . A proper squire ! And who ? and who ? which way looks he ? Bora . Marry , on Hero , the daughter and heir of Leonato . John . A very forward March-chick ! How came you to this ? Bora . Being entertain 'd for a perfumer , as I was smoking a musty room , comes me the Prince and Claudio , hand in hand in sad conference . I whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself , and having obtain 'd her , give her to Count Claudio . John . Come , come , let us thither . This may prove food to my displeasure . That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow . If I can cross him any way , I bless myself every way . You are both sure , and will assist me ? Con . To the death , my lord . John . Let us to the great supper . Their cheer is the greater that I am subdued . Would the cook were o ' my mind ! Shall we go prove what 's to be done ? Bora . We 'll wait upon your lordship .

Enter Leonato , -LSB- Antonio -RSB- his Brother , Hero his Daughter , and Beatrice his Niece , and a Kinsman ; -LSB- also Margaret and Ursula -RSB- . Leon . Was not Count John here at supper ? Ant .

The one is too like an image and says nothing , and the other too like my lady 's eldest son , evermore tattling . Leon . Then half Signior Benedick 's tongue in Count John 's mouth , and half Count John 's melancholy in Signior Benedick 's face -- Beat . With a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world -- if ' a could get her good will . Leon . By my troth , niece , thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue . Ant . In faith , she 's too curst . Beat . Too curst is more than curst . I shall lessen God 's sending that way , for it is said , ` God sends a curst cow short horns , ' but to a cow too curst he sends none . Leon . So , by being too curst , God will send you no horns . Beat . Just , if he send me no husband ; for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening . Lord , I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face . I had rather lie in the woollen ! Leon . You may light on a husband that hath no beard . Beat . What should I do with him ? dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman ? He that hath a beard is more than a youth , and he that hath no beard is less than a man ; and he that is more than a youth is not for me ; and he that is less than a man , I am not for him . Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the berrord and lead his apes into hell . Leon . Well then , go you into hell ? Beat . No ; but to the gate , and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head , and say ` Get you to heaven , Beatrice , get you to heaven . Here 's no place for you maids . ' So deliver I up my apes , and away to Saint Peter -- for the heavens . He shows me where the bachelors sit , and there live we as merry as the day is long . Ant . -LSB- to Hero -RSB- Well , niece , I trust you will be rul 'd by your father . Beat . Yes faith . It is my cousin 's duty to make cursy and say , ` Father , as it please you . ' But yet for all that , cousin , let him be a handsome fellow , or else make another cursy , and say , ` Father , as it please me . ' Leon . Well , niece , I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband . Beat . Not till God make men of some other metal than earth . Would it not grieve a woman to be overmaster 'd with a piece of valiant dust ? to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl ? No , uncle , I 'll none . Adam 's sons are my brethren , and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kinred . Leon . Daughter , remember what I told you . If the Prince do solicit you in that kind , you know your answer . Beat . The fault will be in the music , cousin , if you be not wooed in good time . If the Prince be too important , tell him there is measure in everything , and so dance out the answer . For , hear me , Hero : wooing , wedding , and repenting is as a Scotch jig , a measure , and a cinque-pace : the first suit is hot and hasty like a Scotch jig -- and full as fantastical ; the wedding , mannerly modest , as a measure , full of state and ancientry ; and then comes Repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinque-pace faster and faster , till he sink into his grave . Leon . Cousin , you apprehend passing shrewdly . Beat . I have a good eye , uncle ; I can see a church by daylight . Leon . The revellers are ent ` ring , brother . Make good room . -LSB- Exit Antonio . -RSB- Enter , -LSB- masked , -RSB- Don Pedro , Claudio , Benedick , and Balthasar . -LSB- With them enter Antonio , also masked . After them enter -RSB- Don John -LSB- and Borachio -LRB- without masks -RRB- , who stand aside and look on during the dance -RSB- . Pedro . Lady , will you walk a bout with your friend ? Hero . So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing , I am yours for the walk ; and especially when I walk away . Pedro . With me in your company ? Hero . I may say so when I please . Pedro . And when please you to say so ? Hero . When I like your favour , for God defend the lute should be like the case ! Pedro . My visor is Philemon 's roof ; within the house is Jove . Hero . Why then , your visor should be thatch 'd . Pedro . Speak low if you speak love . -LSB- Takes her aside . -RSB- Balth . Well , I would you did like me . Marg . So would not I for your own sake , for I have many ill qualities . Balth . Which is one ? Marg . I say my prayers aloud . Balth . I love you the better . The hearers may cry Amen . Marg . God match me with a good dancer ! Balth . Amen . Marg . And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done ! Answer , clerk . Balth . No more words . The clerk is answered . -LSB- Takes her aside . -RSB- Urs . I know you well enough . You are Signior Antonio . Ant . At a word , I am not . Urs . I know you by the waggling of your head . Ant . To tell you true , I counterfeit him . Urs . You could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man . Here 's his dry hand up and down . You are he , you are he ! Ant . At a word , I am not . Urs . Come , come , do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit ? Can virtue hide itself ? Go to , mum you are he . Graces will appear , and there 's an end . -LSB- They step aside . -RSB- Beat . Will you not tell me who told you so ? Bene . No , you shall pardon me . Beat . Nor will you not tell me who you are ? Bene . Not now . Beat . That I was disdainful , and that I had my good wit out of the ` Hundred Merry Tales . ' Well , this was Signior Benedick that said so . Bene . What 's he ? Beat . I am sure you know him well enough . Bene . Not I , believe me . Beat . Did he never make you laugh ? Bene . I pray you , what is he ? Beat . Why , he is the Prince 's jester , a very dull fool . Only his gift is in devising impossible slanders . None but libertines delight in him ; and the commendation is not in his wit , but in his villany ; for he both pleases men and angers them , and then they laugh at him and beat him . I am sure he is in the fleet . I would he had boarded me . Bene . When I know the gentleman , I 'll tell him what you say . Beat . Do , do . He 'll but break a comparison or two on me ; which peradventure , not marked or not laugh 'd at , strikes him into melancholy ; and then there 's a partridge wing saved , for the fool will eat no supper that night . -LSB- Music . -RSB- We must follow the leaders . Bene . In every good thing . Beat . Nay , if they lead to any ill , I will leave them at the next turning . Dance . Exeunt -LRB- all but Don John , Borachio , and Claudio -RSB- . John . Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it . The ladies follow her and but one visor remains . Bora . And that is Claudio . I know him by his bearing . John . Are you not Signior Benedick ? Claud . You know me well . I am he . John . Signior , you are very near my brother in his love . He is enamour 'd on Hero . I pray you dissuade him from her ; she is no equal for his birth . You may do the part of an honest man in it . Claud . How know you he loves her ? John . I heard him swear his affection . Bora . So did I too , and he swore he would marry her tonight . John . Come , let us to the banquet . Exeunt . Manet Claudio . Claud . Thus answer I in name of Benedick But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio . -LSB- Unmasks . -RSB- 'T is certain so . The Prince wooes for himself . Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love . Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues ; Let every eye negotiate for itself And trust no agent ; for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood . This is an accident of hourly proof , Which I mistrusted not . Farewell therefore Hero ! Enter Benedick -LSB- unmasked -RSB- . Bene . Count Claudio ? Claud . Yea , the same . Bene . Come , will you go with me ? Claud . Whither ? Bene . Even to the next willow , about your own business , County . What fashion will you wear the garland of ? about your neck , like an usurer 's chain ? or under your arm , like a lieutenant 's scarf ? You must wear it one way , for the Prince hath got your Hero . Claud . I wish him joy of her . Bene . Why , that 's spoken like an honest drovier . So they sell bullocks . But did you think the Prince would have served you thus ? Claud . I pray you leave me . Bene . Ho ! now you strike like the blind man ! 'T was the boy that stole your meat , and you 'll beat the post . Claud . If it will not be , I 'll leave you . Exit . Bene . Alas , poor hurt fowl ! now will he creep into sedges . But , that my Lady Beatrice should know me , and not know me ! The Prince 's fool ! Ha ! it may be I go under that title because I am merry . Yea , but so I am apt to do myself wrong . I am not so reputed . It is the base -LRB- though bitter -RRB- disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out . Well , I 'll be revenged as I may . Enter Don Pedro . Pedro . Now , signior , where 's the Count ? Did you see him ? Bene . Troth , my lord , I have played the part of Lady Fame , I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren . I told him , and I think I told him true , that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady , and I off ` red him my company to a willow tree , either to make him a garland , as being forsaken , or to bind him up a rod , as being worthy to be whipt . Pedro . To be whipt ? What 's his fault ? Bene . The flat transgression of a schoolboy who , being overjoyed with finding a bird 's nest , shows it his companion , and he steals it . Pedro . Wilt thou make a trust a transgression ? The transgression is in the stealer . Bene . Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made , and the garland too ; for the garland he might have worn himself , and the rod he might have bestowed on you , who , as I take it , have stol 'n his bird 's nest . Pedro . I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner . Bene . If their singing answer your saying , by my faith you say honestly . Pedro . The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you . The gentleman that danc 'd with her told her she is much wrong 'd by you . Bene . O , she misus 'd me past the endurance of a block ! An oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her ; my very visor began to assume life and scold with her . She told me , not thinking I had been myself , that I was the Prince 's jester , that I was duller than a great thaw ; huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark , with a whole army shooting at me . She speaks poniards , and every word stabs . If her breath were as terrible as her terminations , there were no living near her ; she would infect to the North Star . I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgress 'd . She would have made Hercules have turn 'd spit , yea , and have cleft his club to make the fire too . Come , talk not of her . You shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel . I would to God some scholar would conjure her , for certainly , while she is here , a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary ; and people sin upon purpose , because they would go thither ; so indeed all disquiet , horror , and perturbation follows her . Enter Claudio and Beatrice , Leonato , Hero . Pedro . Look , here she comes . Bene . Will your Grace command me any service to the world 's end ? I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on ; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia ; bring you the length of Prester John 's foot ; fetch you a hair off the great Cham 's beard ; do you any embassage to the Pygmies -- rather than hold three words ' conference with this harpy . You have no employment for me ? Pedro . None , but to desire your good company . Bene . O God , sir , here 's a dish I love not ! I can not endure my Lady Tongue . -LSB- Exit . -RSB- Pedro . Come , lady , come ; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick . Beat . Indeed , my lord , he lent it me awhile , and I gave him use for it -- a double heart for his single one . Marry , once before he won it of me with false dice ; therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it . Pedro . You have put him down , lady ; you have put him down . Beat . So I would not he should do me , my lord , lest I should prove the mother of fools . I have brought Count Claudio , whom you sent me to seek . Pedro . Why , how now , Count ? Wherefore are you sad ? Claud . Not sad , my lord . Pedro . How then ? sick ? Claud . Neither , my lord . Beat . The Count is neither sad , nor sick , nor merry , nor well ; but civil count -- civil as an orange , and something of that jealous complexion . Pedro . I ' faith , lady , I think your blazon to be true ; though I 'll be sworn , if he be so , his conceit is false . Here , Claudio , I have wooed in thy name , and fair Hero is won . I have broke with her father , and his good will obtained . Name the day of marriage , and God give thee joy ! Leon . Count , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes . His Grace hath made the match , and all grace say Amen to it ! Beat . Speak , Count , 't is your cue . Claud . Silence is the perfectest herald of joy . I were but little happy if I could say how much . Lady , as you are mine , I am yours . I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange . Beat . Speak , cousin ; or , if you can not , stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither . Pedro . In faith , lady , you have a merry heart . Beat . Yea , my lord ; I thank it , poor fool , it keeps on the windy side of care . My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart . Claud . And so she doth , cousin . Beat . Good Lord , for alliance ! Thus goes every one to the world but I , and I am sunburnt . I may sit in a corner and cry ` Heigh-ho for a husband ! ' Pedro . Lady Beatrice , I will get you one . Beat . I would rather have one of your father 's getting . Hath your Grace ne'er a brother like you ? Your father got excellent husbands , if a maid could come by them . Pedro . Will you have me , lady ? Beat . No , my lord , unless I might have another for working days : your Grace is too costly to wear every day . But I beseech your Grace pardon me . I was born to speak all mirth and no matter . Pedro . Your silence most offends me , and to be merry best becomes you , for out o ' question you were born in a merry hour . Beat . No , sure , my lord , my mother cried ; but then there was a star danc 'd , and under that was I born . Cousins , God give you joy ! Leon . Niece , will you look to those things I told you of ? Beat . I cry you mercy , uncle , By your Grace 's pardon . Exit . Pedro . By my troth , a pleasant-spirited lady . Leon . There 's little of the melancholy element in her , my lord . She is never sad but when she sleeps , and not ever sad then ; for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness and wak 'd herself with laughing . Pedro . She can not endure to hear tell of a husband . Leon . O , by no means ! She mocks all her wooers out of suit . Pedro . She were an excellent wife for Benedick . Leon . O Lord , my lord ! if they were but a week married , they would talk themselves mad . Pedro . County Claudio , when mean you to go to church ? Claud . To-morrow , my lord . Time goes on crutches till love have all his rites . Leon . Not till Monday , my dear son , which is hence a just sevennight ; and a time too brief too , to have all things answer my mind . Pedro . Come , you shake the head at so long a breathing ; but I warrant thee , Claudio , the time shall not go dully by us . I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules ' labours , which is , to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection th ' one with th ' other . I would fain have it a match , and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction . Leon . My lord , I am for you , though it cost me ten nights ' watchings . Claud . And I , my lord . Pedro . And you too , gentle Hero ? Hero . I will do any modest office , my lord , to help my cousin to a good husband . Pedro . And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know . Thus far can I praise him : he is of a noble strain , of approved valour , and confirm 'd honesty . I will teach you how to humour your cousin , that she shall fall in love with Benedick ; and I , -LSB- to Leonato and Claudio -RSB- with your two helps , will so practise on Benedick that , in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach , he shall fall in love with Beatrice . If we can do this , Cupid is no longer an archer ; his glory shall be ours , for we are the only love-gods . Go in with me , and I will tell you my drift . Exeunt . Scene II . A hall in Leonato 's house . Enter -LSB- Don -RSB- John and Borachio . John . It is so . The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato . Bora . Yea , my lord ; but I can cross it . John . Any bar , any cross , any impediment will be med ` cinable to me . I am sick in displeasure to him , and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine . How canst thou cross this marriage ? Bora . Not honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me . John . Show me briefly how . Bora . I think I told your lordship , a year since , how much I am in the favour of Margaret , the waiting gentlewoman to Hero . John . I remember . Bora . I can , at any unseasonable instant of the night , appoint her to look out at her lady 's chamber window . John . What life is in that to be the death of this marriage ? Bora . The poison of that lies in you to temper . Go you to the Prince your brother ; spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned Claudio -LRB- whose estimation do you mightily hold up -RRB- to a contaminated stale , such a one as Hero . John . What proof shall I make of that ? Bora . Proof enough to misuse the Prince , to vex Claudio , to undo Hero , and kill Leonato . Look you for any other issue ? John . Only to despite them I will endeavour anything . Bora . Go then ; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone ; tell them that you know that Hero loves me ; intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio , as -- in love of your brother 's honour , who hath made this match , and his friend 's reputation , who is thus like to be cozen 'd with the semblance of a maid -- that you have discover 'd thus . They will scarcely believe this without trial . Offer them instances ; which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window , hear me call Margaret Hero , hear Margaret term me Claudio ; and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding -LRB- for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent -RRB- and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero 's disloyalty that jealousy shall be call 'd assurance and all the preparation overthrown . John . Grow this to what adverse issue it can , I will put it in practice . Be cunning in the working this , and thy fee is a thousand ducats . Bora . Be you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me . John . I will presently go learn their day of marriage . Exeunt . Scene III . Leonato 's orchard . Enter Benedick alone . Bene . Boy ! -LSB- Enter Boy . -RSB- Boy . Signior ? Bene . In my chamber window lies a book . Bring it hither to me in the orchard . Boy . I am here already , sir . Bene . I know that , but I would have thee hence and here again . -LRB- Exit Boy . -RRB- I do much wonder that one man , seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love , will , after he hath laugh 'd at such shallow follies in others , become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love ; and such a man is Claudio . I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife ; and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe . I have known when he would have walk 'd ten mile afoot to see a good armour ; and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet . He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose , like an honest man and a soldier ; and now is he turn 'd orthography ; his words are a very fantastical banquet -- just so many strange dishes . May I be so converted and see with these eyes ? I can not tell ; I think not . I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster ; but I 'll take my oath on it , till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool . One woman is fair , yet I am well ; another is wise , yet I am well ; another virtuous , yet I am well ; but till all graces be in one woman , one woman shall not come in my grace . Rich she shall be , that 's certain ; wise , or I 'll none ; virtuous , or I 'll never cheapen her ; fair , or I 'll never look on her ; mild , or come not near me ; noble , or not I for an angel ; of good discourse , an excellent musician , and her hair shall be of what colour it please God . Ha , the Prince and Monsieur Love ! I will hide me in the arbour . -LSB- Hides . -RSB- Enter Don Pedro , Leonato , Claudio . Music -LSB- within -RSB- . Pedro . Come , shall we hear this music ? Claud . Yea , my good lord . How still the evening is , As hush 'd on purpose to grace harmony ! Pedro . See you where Benedick hath hid himself ? Claud . O , very well , my lord . The music ended , We 'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth . Enter Balthasar with Music . Pedro . Come , Balthasar , we 'll hear that song again . Balth . O , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice To slander music any more than once . Pedro . It is the witness still of excellency To put a strange face on his own perfection . I pray thee sing , and let me woo no more . Balth . Because you talk of wooing , I will sing , Since many a wooer doth commence his suit To her he thinks not worthy , yet he wooes , Yet will he swear he loves . Pedro . Nay , pray thee come ; Or if thou wilt hold longer argument , Do it in notes . Balth . Note this before my notes : There 's not a note of mine that 's worth the noting . Pedro . Why , these are very crotchets that he speaks ! Note notes , forsooth , and nothing ! -LSB- Music . -RSB- Bene . -LSB- aside -RSB- Now divine air ! Now is his soul ravish 'd ! Is it not strange that sheep 's guts should hale souls out of men 's bodies ? Well , a horn for my money , when all 's done . -LSB- Balthasar sings . -RSB- The Song . Sigh no more , ladies , sigh no more ! Men were deceivers ever , One foot in sea , and one on shore ; To one thing constant never . Then sigh not so , But let them go , And be you blithe and bonny , Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny , nonny . Sing no more ditties , sing no moe , Of dumps so dull and heavy ! The fraud of men was ever so , Since summer first was leavy . Then sigh not so , & c. Pedro . By my troth , a good song . Balth . And an ill singer , my lord . Pedro . Ha , no , no , faith ! Thou sing ` st well enough for a shift . Bene . -LSB- aside -RSB- An he had been a dog that should have howl 'd thus , they would have hang 'd him ; and I pray God his bad voice bode no mischief . I had as live have heard the night raven , come what plague could have come after it . Pedro . Yea , marry . Dost thou hear , Balthasar ? I pray thee get us some excellent music ; for to-morrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero 's chamber window . Balth . The best I can , my lord . Pedro . Do so . Farewell . Exit Balthasar -LSB- with Musicians -RSB- . Come hither , Leonato . What was it you told me of to-day ? that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick ? Claud . O , ay ! - -LSB- Aside to Pedro -RSB- Stalk on , stalk on ; the fowl sits . -- I did never think that lady would have loved any man . Leon . No , nor I neither ; but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signior Benedick , whom she hath in all outward behaviours seem 'd ever to abhor . Bene . -LSB- aside -RSB- Is ' t possible ? Sits the wind in that corner ? Leon . By my troth , my lord , I can not tell what to think of it , but that she loves him with an enraged affection . It is past the infinite of thought . Pedro . May be she doth but counterfeit . Claud . Faith , like enough . Leon . O God , counterfeit ? There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it . Pedro . Why , what effects of passion shows she ? Claud . -LSB- aside -RSB- Bait the hook well ! This fish will bite . Leon . What effects , my lord ? She will sit you -- you heard my daughter tell you how . Claud . She did indeed . Pedro . How , how , I pray you ? You amaze me . I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection . Leon . I would have sworn it had , my lord -- especially against Benedick . Bene . -LSB- aside -RSB- I should think this a gull but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it . Knavery can not , sure , hide himself in such reverence . Claud . -LSB- aside -RSB- He hath ta'en th ' infection . Hold it up . Pedro . Hath she made her affection known to Benedick ? Leon . No , and swears she never will . That 's her torment . Claud . 'T is true indeed . So your daughter says . ` Shall I , ' says she , ` that have so oft encount ` red him with scorn , write to him that I love him ?
