She writes ; ' I have not seen Josef for a long time , I was in the bank last week but Josef was so busy that they would not let me through ; I waited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go home as I had my piano lesson . I would have liked to have spoken to him , maybe there will be a chance another time . He sent me a big box of chocolates for my name-day , that was very nice and attentive of him . I forgot to tell you about it when I wrote , and I only remember now that you ask me about it . Chocolate , as I am sure you are aware , disappears straight away in this lodging house , almost as soon as you know somebody has given you chocolate it is gone . But there is something else I wanted to tell you about Josef . Like I said , they would not let me through to see him at the bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just then . After I had been waiting quietly for quite a long time I asked one of the staff whether his meeting would last much longer . He said it might well do , as it was probably about the legal proceedings , he said , that were being conducted against him . I asked what sort of legal proceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk , and whether he was not making some mistake , but he said he was not making any mistake , there were legal proceedings underway and even that they were about something quite serious , but he did not know any more about it . He would have liked to have been of some help to the chief clerk himself , as the chief clerk was a gentleman , good and honest , but he did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be some influential gentlemen who would take his side . I 'm sure that is what will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the end , but in the mean time things do not look at all good , and you can see that from the mood of the chief clerk himself . Of course , I did not place too much importance on this conversation , and even did my best to put the bank clerk 's mind at rest , he was quite a simple man . I told him he was not to speak to anyone else about this , and I think it is all just a rumour , but I still think it might be good if you , Dear Father , if you looked into the matter the next time you visit . It will be easy for you to find out more detail and , if it is really necessary , to do something about it through the great and influential people you know .

You should be ashamed of yourself here in front of my client ! And you 're destroying the trust he has for me . Just what is it you want ? You 're still alive , you 're still under my protection . There 's no point in worrying ! Somewhere you 've read that the final judgement can often come without warning , from anyone at any time . And , in the right circumstances , that 's basically true , but it 's also true that I dislike your anxiety and fear and see that you do n't have the trust in me you should have . Now what have I just said ? I repeated something said by one of the judges . You know that there are so many various opinions about the procedure that they form into a great big pile and nobody can make any sense of them . This judge , for instance , sees proceedings as starting at a different point from where I do . A difference of opinion , nothing more . At a certain stage in the proceedings tradition has it that a sign is given by ringing a bell . This judge sees that as the point at which proceedings begin . I ca n't set out all the opinions opposed to that view here , and you would n't understand it anyway , suffice it to say that there are many reasons to disagree with him .

' I work for the court , ' he said , ` what court ? ' said I. And that 's when he told me about the court . I 'm sure you can imagine how amazed I was at being told all this . Ever since then I learn something new about the court every time he comes to visit , and so little by little I get to understand something of how it works . Anyway , Titorelli talks a lot and I often have to push him away , not only because he 's bound to be lying but also , most of all , because a businessman like me who 's already close to breaking point under the weight of his own business worries ca n't pay too much attention to other people 's . But all that 's just by the by . Perhaps - this is what I 've been thinking - perhaps Titorelli might be able to help you in some small way , he knows lots of judges and even if he ca n't have much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to get some influential people on your side . And even if this advice does n't turn out to make all the difference I still think it 'll be very important once you 've got it . You 're nearly a lawyer yourself . That 's what I always say , Mr. K. the chief clerk is nearly a lawyer . Oh I 'm sure this trial of yours will turn out all right . So do you want to go and see Titorelli , then ? If I ask him to he 'll certainly do everything he possibly can . I really do think you ought to go . It need n't be today , of course , just some time , when you get the chance . And anyway - I want to tell you this too - you do n't actually have to go and see Titorelli , this advice from me does n't place you under any obligation at all . No , if you think you can get by without Titorelli it 'll certainly be better to leave him completely out of it . Maybe you 've already got a clear idea of what you 're doing and Titorelli could upset your plans . No , if that 's the case then of course you should n't go there under any circumstances ! And it certainly wo n't be easy to take advice from a lad like that . Still , it 's up to you . Here 's the letter of recommendation and here 's the address .

'' ","i":60543},{"w":"`` Well , positions like that , that are n't officially acknowledged , can often have more influence than those that are . '' ","i":64085},{"w":"`` What is that ? '' ","i":71295},{"w":"`` Answer me ! '' ","i":73543},{"w":"`` so much the better . Otherwise I might have needed to apologise to you . It is a peculiarity of Leni 's . I 've long since forgiven her for it , and I would n't be talking of it now , if you had n't locked the door just now . Anyway , perhaps I should at least explain this peculiarity of hers to you , but you seem rather disturbed , the way you 're looking at me , and so that 's why I 'll do it , this peculiarity of hers consists in this ; Leni finds most of the accused attractive . She attaches herself to each of them , loves each of them , even seems to be loved by each of them ; then she sometimes entertains me by telling me about them when I allow her to . I am not so astonished by all of this as you seem to be . If you look at them in the right way the accused really can be attractive , quite often . But that is a remarkable and to some extent scientific phenomenon . Being indicted does not cause any clear , precisely definable change in a person 's appearance , of course . But it 's not like with other legal matters , most of them remain in their usual way of life and , if they have a good lawyer looking after them , the trial does n't get in their way . But there are nonetheless those who have experience in these matters who can look at a crowd , however big , and tell you which among them is facing a charge . How can they do that , you will ask . My answer will not please you . It is simply that those who are facing a charge are the most attractive . It can not be their guilt that makes them attractive as not all of them are guilty - at least that 's what I , as a lawyer , have to say - and nor can it be the proper punishment that has made them attractive as not all of them are punished , so it can only be that the proceedings levelled against them take some kind of hold on them . Whatever the reason , some of these attractive people are indeed very attractive . But all of them are attractive , even Block , pitiful worm that he is .
