My impression is , that our wonderfully increased and still increasing facilities of locomotion are destined to bring us around again to the nomadic state . You are aware , my dear sir , -- you must have observed it in your own experience , -- that all human progress is in a circle ; or , to use a more accurate and beautiful figure , in an ascending spiral curve . While we fancy ourselves going straight forward , and attaining , at every step , an entirely new position of affairs , we do actually return to something long ago tried and abandoned , but which we now find etherealized , refined , and perfected to its ideal . The past is but a coarse and sensual prophecy of the present and the future . To apply this truth to the topic now under discussion . In the early epochs of our race , men dwelt in temporary huts , of bowers of branches , as easily constructed as a bird 's - nest , and which they built , -- if it should be called building , when such sweet homes of a summer solstice rather grew than were made with hands , -- which Nature , we will say , assisted them to rear where fruit abounded , where fish and game were plentiful , or , most especially , where the sense of beauty was to be gratified by a lovelier shade than elsewhere , and a more exquisite arrangement of lake , wood , and hill . This life possessed a charm which , ever since man quitted it , has vanished from existence . And it typified something better than itself . It had its drawbacks ; such as hunger and thirst , inclement weather , hot sunshine , and weary and foot-blistering marches over barren and ugly tracts , that lay between the sites desirable for their fertility and beauty . But in our ascending spiral , we escape all this . These railroads -- could but the whistle be made musical , and the rumble and the jar got rid of -- are positively the greatest blessing that the ages have wrought out for us . They give us wings ; they annihilate the toil and dust of pilgrimage ; they spiritualize travel ! Transition being so facile , what can be any man 's inducement to tarry in one spot ? Why , therefore , should he build a more cumbrous habitation than can readily be carried off with him ? Why should he make himself a prisoner for life in brick , and stone , and old worm-eaten timber , when he may just as easily dwell , in one sense , nowhere , -- in a better sense , wherever the fit and beautiful shall offer him a home ?

Not that I should ever visit its site again ! for , sir , the farther I get away from it , the more does the joy , the lightsome freshness , the heart-leap , the intellectual dance , the youth , in short , -- yes , my youth , my youth ! -- the more does it come back to me . No longer ago than this morning , I was old . I remember looking in the glass , and wondering at my own gray hair , and the wrinkles , many and deep , right across my brow , and the furrows down my cheeks , and the prodigious trampling of crow 's - feet about my temples ! It was too soon ! I could not bear it ! Age had no right to come ! I had not lived ! But now do I look old ? If so , my aspect belies me strangely ; for -- a great weight being off my mind -- I feel in the very heyday of my youth , with the world and my best days before me !

Just imagine , for a moment , how much of human evil will crumble away , with this one change ! What we call real estate -- the solid ground to build a house on -- is the broad foundation on which nearly all the guilt of this world rests . A man will commit almost any wrong , -- he will heap up an immense pile of wickedness , as hard as granite , and which will weigh as heavily upon his soul , to eternal ages , -- only to build a great , gloomy , dark-chambered mansion , for himself to die in , and for his posterity to be miserable in . He lays his own dead corpse beneath the underpinning , as one may say , and hangs his frowning picture on the wall , and , after thus converting himself into an evil destiny , expects his remotest great-grandchildren to be happy there .
