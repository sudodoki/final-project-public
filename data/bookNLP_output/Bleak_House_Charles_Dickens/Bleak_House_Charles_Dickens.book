I worked it out in my mind while I was talking to her at supper . When I went upstairs to bed , our house being small and this young woman 's ears sharp , I stuffed the sheet into Mrs. Bucket 's mouth that she should n't say a word of surprise and told her all about it .

I watched this young woman yesterday without her knowledge when she was looking at the funeral , in company with my wife , who planned to take her there ; and I had so much to convict her , and I saw such an expression in her face , and my mind so rose against her malice towards her ladyship , and the time was altogether such a time for bringing down what you may call retribution upon her , that if I had been a younger hand with less experience , I should have taken her , certain . Equally , last night , when her ladyship , as is so universally admired I am sure , come home looking -- why , Lord , a man might almost say like Venus rising from the ocean -- it was so unpleasant and inconsistent to think of her being charged with a murder of which she was innocent that I felt quite to want to put an end to the job . What should I have lost ? Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I should have lost the weapon . My prisoner here proposed to Mrs. Bucket , after the departure of the funeral , that they should go per bus a little ways into the country and take tea at a very decent house of entertainment . Now , near that house of entertainment there 's a piece of water . At tea , my prisoner got up to fetch her pocket handkercher from the bedroom where the bonnets was ; she was rather a long time gone and came back a little out of wind . As soon as they came home this was reported to me by Mrs. Bucket , along with her observations and suspicions . I had the piece of water dragged by moonlight , in presence of a couple of our men , and the pocket pistol was brought up before it had been there half-a-dozen hours .

If I follow her alone , she , being in ignorance of what Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , has communicated to me , may be driven to desperation . But if I follow her in company with a young lady , answering to the description of a young lady that she has a tenderness for -- I ask no question , and I say no more than that -- she will give me credit for being friendly .

My father -LRB- a farmer -RRB- made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my mother for her life . After my mother 's death , all was to come to me except a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my brother . My mother died . My brother some time afterwards claimed his legacy . I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it already in board and lodging and some other things . Now mind ! That was the question , and nothing else . No one disputed the will ; no one disputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had been already paid or not . To settle that question , my brother filing a bill , I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery ; I was forced there because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else . Seventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit ! It first came on after two years . It was then stopped for another two years while the master -LRB- may his head rot off ! -RRB- inquired whether I was my father 's son , about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal creature . He then found out that there were not defendants enough -- remember , there were only seventeen as yet ! -- but that we must have another who had been left out and must begin all over again . The costs at that time -- before the thing was begun ! -- were three times the legacy . My brother would have given up the legacy , and joyful , to escape more costs . My whole estate , left to me in that will of my father 's , has gone in costs . The suit , still undecided , has fallen into rack , and ruin , and despair , with everything else -- and here I stand , this day !

It would be better for me , they tell me , if I restrained myself . I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become imbecile . I was a good-enough-tempered man once , I believe . People in my part of the country say they remember me so , but now I must have this vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits together .

I wish to leave my good name unsullied , together with any little property of which I may become possessed through industry and perseverance , to my daughters Emma , Jane , and Caroline . I also desire to live in amity with my professional brethren . When Mr. Skimpole did me the honour , sir -- I will not say the very high honour , for I never stoop to flattery -- of bringing us together in this room , I mentioned to you that I could offer no opinion or advice as to your interests while those interests were entrusted to another member of the profession . And I spoke in such terms as I was bound to speak of Kenge and Carboy 's office , which stands high . You , sir , thought fit to withdraw your interests from that keeping nevertheless and to offer them to me . You brought them with clean hands , sir , and I accepted them with clean hands . Those interests are now paramount in this office . My digestive functions , as you may have heard me mention , are not in a good state , and rest might improve them ; but I shall not rest , sir , while I am your representative . Whenever you want me , you will find me here . Summon me anywhere , and I will come . During the long vacation , sir , I shall devote my leisure to studying your interests more and more closely and to making arrangements for moving heaven and earth -LRB- including , of course , the Chancellor -RRB- after Michaelmas term ; and when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , '' ","i":271573},{"w":"`` For there have been many little consultations and attendances of late , sir , '' ","i":272054},{"w":"`` and these things mount up , and I do n't profess to be a man of capital . When we first entered on our present relations I stated to you openly -- it is a principle of mine that there never can be too much openness between solicitor and client -- that I was not a man of capital and that if capital was your object you had better leave your papers in Kenge 's office . No , Mr. C. , you will find none of the advantages or disadvantages of capital here , sir . This , '' ","i":272081},{"w":"`` is your rock ; it pretends to be nothing more .

's professional adviser , that Mr. C. 's circumstances are at the present moment in an embarrassed state . Not so much in point of amount as owing to the peculiar and pressing nature of liabilities Mr. C. has incurred and the means he has of liquidating or meeting the same . I have staved off many little matters for Mr. C. , but there is a limit to staving off , and we have reached it . I have made some advances out of pocket to accommodate these unpleasantnesses , but I necessarily look to being repaid , for I do not pretend to be a man of capital , and I have a father to support in the Vale of Taunton , besides striving to realize some little independence for three dear girls at home . My apprehension is , Mr. C. 's circumstances being such , lest it should end in his obtaining leave to part with his commission , which at all events is desirable to be made known to his connexions .

My wish is that everything should be openly carried on . I desire to leave a good name behind me . If I consulted merely my own interests with Mr. C. , I should not be here . So insurmountable , as you must well know , would be his objections . This is not a professional attendance . This can he charged to nobody .
